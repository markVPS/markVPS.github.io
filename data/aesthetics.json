The movement's name comes from 2 Tone Records, the influential record label founded by Jerry Dammers of The Specials, which served as the cultural and musical hub of the scene.",

        "description": "This aesthetic is largely based on the brands Abercrombie and Fitch, Hollister, and American Eagle, which were commonly found in American malls during the 2000s, when mall culture was prominent in the mainstream. The uniting concepts behind them were sporty, laid-back interpretations of New England Preppy garments, which were also based on sporty fashions, albeit in a more vintage and \"stuffy\" context. These brands also incorporated California in their marketing, with connections to Surfer culture and aspirationally attractive models. This is especially true for brands such as Hollister Co. and Pac Sun and with TV shows such as The Hills, Laguna Beach, and The OC.",

This image of a prosperous and orderly \"American Dream\" was heavily promoted through the advertising and television sitcoms of the period. While often viewed with nostalgia, the aesthetic is also criticized for its rigid social conformity and its exclusion of non-white and non-traditional families, and its idyllic surface has been famously subverted in the Suburban Gothic genre.",

Another common design element is text with a dropshadow to add legibility or visual appeal. Because of the low resolution (the consoles in particular were limited to 256-pixel resolution) of these systems relative to the display, the pixels were extremely large, particularly on consumer televisions which could easily be twice the size of a typical CRT display. While 8-bit is generally understood to correspond primarily with the Sega Master System and NES-based console games, this page includes earlier and similar-era media on other platforms like arcades and computers.",

The aesthetic was further cemented in popular culture by media like the 1981 music video for Olivia Newton-John's song \"Physical\" and the 1983 film Flashdance, both of which showcased dance-inspired fitness attire.",

        "description": "Adventure Pulp originated in the \"Lost World\" genre of fiction, popularized in the late Victorian and Edwardian eras by authors like H. Rider Haggard. These stories, inspired by real-life colonial expeditions, filled the public imagination with images of unexplored continents and forgotten civilizations. This formula was perfectly suited for the cheap, mass-produced pulp magazines of the 1930s and 1940s, which solidified the genre's visual identity through their dynamic cover art. After the decline of the pulp era, the aesthetic was famously revived in the 1980s with films that paid homage to the original serials, cementing the look and feel of the genre for a new generation.",

        "description": "Rebelling against Victorian materialism and the perceived decline of craftsmanship due to industrialization, Aesthetic artists valued quality in all artistic creation, sometimes reviving pre-industrial techniques. The movement's central tenet, \"art for art's sake,\" divorced art from obligations to convey moral or socio-political messages, instead emphasizing the exploration of color, form, and composition in the pursuit of beauty. In contrast to typical Victorian decor, Aesthetic art often featured subdued colors, geometric designs, and simplified linear forms, drawing inspiration from Pre-Raphaelite painting, medieval art, and Japanese motifs.",

        "description": "The exact color of the so-called aether may vary between examples. In the Kaladesh Plane from Magic the Gathering, the aether has a distinct neon blue, similar to Arcane's upper-class utopian city Piltover. The Undercity, on the other hand, has a green tinge or as another wiki editor described it \"Green everywhere, just green things everywhere.\" This darker, undercity variety can also be seen in video games like Bioshock. Depending on the universe, aether may be a naturally occurring phenomenon or a scientifically harnessed one, and colors are often used to differentiate this attitude. This juxtaposition can often be used as a key story element for aetherpunk worlds. Conflict can arise between those who are in tune with natural aether, those who harness and exploit aether, and all the questions about who is able and allowed to access this fundamental, world changing resource gives rise to rebellious factions with a variety of motivations. It also commonly uses stone and gold for most structures with the emphasis being on the gold as well as large amounts of pagan imagery.",

Curator Ingrid LaFleur describes it as a method for envisioning future possibilities through a black cultural lens. Bennett Capers' work, as summarized by Kathy Brown, characterizes Afrofuturism as a practice that acknowledges both historical and future-oriented perspectives, addressing a difficult past and present while focusing on future prosperity. The genre is described as adaptable, integrating technology, African culture, and other influences.",

The emptiness of the abandoned space and the remains of its former vitality can create a powerful emotional response. For some, it might cause them to reflect on the passage of time, the transience of life, or the impermanence of human activities. The always-present tranquility of After Hours distinguishes it from the adjacent aesthetic of Liminal Space, which is intentionally designed to be unsettling and foreboding.",

        "description": "The aesthetics of classic arcades have had a lasting impact on popular culture, serving as a deep well of inspiration for various modern art forms and internet subcultures. The nostalgic appeal of 8-bit graphics, chiptune music, and the overall sensory environment has been reinterpreted in numerous ways. The music and visual aesthetic of Synthwave, for example, is heavily indebted to the 1980s, with arcades as a central theme in its neon-gridded, futuristic visuals that directly reference the look of classic games. Similarly, while drawing from a broader range of nostalgia, Vaporwave frequently incorporates elements of early computer and video game graphics, evoking a sense of digital history connected to the arcade era. This influence also extends to Glitch Art, a form that intentionally uses digital errors for aesthetic purposes, harkening back to the visual artifacts of early video game hardware. Furthermore, the resurgence of pixel art in modern indie gaming is a direct homage to the arcade era, with many contemporary developers making a deliberate artistic choice to evoke nostalgia and celebrate the timeless appeal of classic game design.",

The movement sought to break down the artificial hierarchy between the fine arts (painting and sculpture) and the decorative arts, arguing that a beautiful and useful object, like a chair or wallpaper, was a significant work of art.",

        "description": "The term \"Avant Apocalypse\" was coined in 2021 by trend forecaster Mandy Lee on TikTok, where the aesthetic gained popularity. It emerged as an evolution of the subversive basics movement, which featured minimal wardrobe staples like tank tops and blazers updated with asymmetric cuts, exposed skin, and strategic layering. Subversive basics focused on reclaiming the body through deconstructed garments and unconventional silhouettes.",

        "description": "Avant Basic design often incorporates elements of 1960s and Memphis Design, featuring patterns like checkerboard, abstract florals, and organic swirls. It emphasizes a playful and whimsical atmosphere, achieved through the use of pastel hues such as light blues, pinks, oranges, and greens, alongside neutral tones. The aesthetic encourages the mixing of patterns and textures, such as shag rugs paired with metallic decor. Its popularity increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, largely due to its prevalence on social media, where it developed. The trend also features work from new designers, specifically those from female, queer, non-binary, and minority-owned businesses.",

Over time, the term lost its negative connotations. The defining characteristics of Baroque art are drama, movement, and emotional intensity. Artists sought to capture the most dramatic moment of a story, using dynamic compositions with strong diagonal lines, swirling forms, and figures caught in motion. In painting, the technique of chiaroscuro (the use of strong contrasts between light and dark) was perfected by artists like Caravaggio to create theatrical effects.",

It stands apart from the more glamorous and art-focused Movida Madrileña, favoring a grittier, more visceral style that mirrored the harsh realities of unemployment, the heroin crisis, and political violence that defined the region at the time.",

Unlike the preceding Arts and Crafts movement, which rejected industrialization, the Bauhaus embraced the machine and sought to harness technology for social good. Aesthetically, the Bauhaus is known for its use of clean lines, simple geometric forms (circles, squares, triangles), and a palette often restricted to primary colors (red, yellow, blue), black, and white. Its innovative curriculum began with a preliminary course (Vorkurs) that taught students the fundamentals of materials, color theory, and composition before they entered specialized workshops.",

        "description": "Blokette, a microtrend popularized on TikTok, was coined by the fashion commentary podcast Nymphet Alumni in late 2022. This aesthetic blends elements of Blokecore and Coquette styles. Blokecore involves masculine-leaning pieces such as oversized football jerseys, vintage sports jackets, and Adidas Sambas, drawing from a simplified interpretation of English pub and sports culture. In contrast, the Coquette aesthetic is hyper-feminine, focusing on elements like mini skirts, knee-high socks, and hair ribbons.",

It is taken from the often outlandish looks of cheaply-made 1930s-1980s B-horror movies, which aimed not to stay in the public consciousness as great pieces of art but instead to entertain (and in this case scare) audiences for the duration of their runtimes, and make some money, then be forgotten. Still, many of these old horror films have gained cult followings and enjoy a place in modern culture thanks to memorable characters, plots, effects, and of course the aesthetic. Features of this aesthetic include grainy or washed-out-looking footage, cheap effects (especially prosthetics and fake blood), ridiculous but distinctively styled posters, and dramatic title screens.",

Bodikon is therefore classified as “Gal”, and can be considered a part of the larger Ametora umbrella (which includes styles like Amekaji), though it does not typically emulate 1980s and early 1990s American fashion trends.",

The modern BCBG subculture evolved as a reaction against the countercultural movements of the era, such as the Hippie and Bohemian styles, offering a more traditional and sophisticated alternative. Characterized by an elegant and relaxed style inspired by prestigious French schools, it became associated with a specific lifestyle and even naming conventions.",

The movement was officially named in 1994.",

Within Brazil, the trend emerged as a conscious effort to reclaim national symbols, particularly the flag and the national football jersey, after they had been heavily co-opted by supporters of the far-right former president, Jair Bolsonaro. For many, wearing the colors became an act of \"depoliticizing\" them and reasserting that they belong to all Brazilians.",

        "description": "Carnival was introduced in Brazil in the 1800s, with Shrovetide, where there was a play brought by the Portuguese that consisted of throwing water, flour, eggs and paint at each other. This play ended up being adopted and also seen as a form of entertainment by the African slaves who lived in the Brazilian colonies, who had fun in their free time while mixing drumming and African rhythms with Portuguese music. This mixture of genres and rhythms would give rise to the carnival marchinhas and samba, which would become fundamental genres for the festival. The original Shrovetide play, however, was no longer practiced, because many upper-class citizens saw it as something uncivilized for the party, which made them adopt elements from Carnivals in other countries (specifically France) that replaced water, flour and eggs with colorful confetti, streamers and bouquets of flowers, which was seen as the most ideal for the festivity. Another element adopted from these countries were the traditional masks, originating from the Masquerade Ball, which were also well received.",

The name comes from the belt buckles that are rodeo prizes that the rodeo winners will give to them if they like them enough. They are considered groupies and get criticized by Country women for being fake. This type of style seems to have gained recent recognition through the Coquette community on Pinterest, and it overlaps with the other Coquette subtypes of Farmers Daughter and Trailer Park Princess. Buckle Bunny re-emerged in popularity in 2024 thanks to the pop musician Chappell Roan and her album The Rise and fall of the midwest princess.",

A key feature of the style was the prominent use of designer patterns, most famously the Burberry check, which was often worn in the form of baseball caps and scarves, though its prevalence was largely through the counterfeit market. The look is accessorized with bold, often gold-plated, jewelry such as large hoop earrings for women (\"chavettes\") and heavy chain necklaces for men. Associated grooming styles include specific haircuts, the use of artificial tanning products, and a distinct makeup application featuring heavy foundation, dramatically defined eyebrows, and thick mascara or false eyelashes.",

Some have also described the Chunyu aesthetic as \"sweet and salty\". To achieve a flawless Chunyu look, a woman must style herself to look beautiful, but without it seeming as if she is trying to be beautiful. Her Chunyu aesthetic should appear effortless and elegant.",

The Club format that we know today didn't become popular until the 1970s with the rise of the Disco clubs of the time (most famously Studio 54) that were safe havens for marginalized groups such as members of the LGBTQ+ and POC communities, the Jewish community, and even women (who considered these clubs to be safer than the discothèques of the time, which had an every-woman-for-every-three-men law they abided by) would favor coming here to just go out and have fun without having to worry about men trying to hit on and harass them.",

Nicoleta defined the aesthetic by referencing the style of characters in Nancy Meyers films, the domesticity of Ina Garten, and a general feeling of comfort and simple luxury. The term quickly went viral and was amplified by major fashion and lifestyle publications. Its popularity was further cemented by endorsements from celebrities who are considered icons of the style, including Diane Keaton and Anne Hathaway, transforming it from a niche TikTok trend into a mainstream cultural phenomenon.",

As a result, there has been a growing awareness for this minimalist look, with many people complaining about the monotony and oversaturation of the style.",

However, despite its progressive and subversive aspects, Cottagecore has been criticized for romanticizing Eurocentric farming life and, in North American and Australian contexts, for inadvertently celebrating colonial aesthetics. This contrasts with its simultaneous adoption by the politically conservative Tradwife movement, which is drawn to the same traditional imagery but for reasons of reinforcing patriarchal gender roles, creating a significant ideological tension within the aesthetic.",

There is often a thematic overlap with Witchcore, centering on the archetype of a solitary witch living in harmony with a powerful and destructive version of nature.",

The first was the late work of Post-Impressionist painter Paul Cézanne, who treated nature in terms of its underlying geometric forms, such as the cylinder, sphere, and cone. The second was the non-Western art of Africa and ancient Iberia, which offered a more conceptual and less naturalistic way of representing forms. Picasso’s 1907 painting, Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, is considered a seminal work that marks the beginning of Cubism, integrating these influences into a new, radical visual language.",

He famously declared that the \"PC is the LSD of the 1990s\" and encouraged a new generation to \"turn on, boot up, jack in.\" Leary and other proponents saw personal computers, the internet, and virtual reality not just as tools, but as gateways to new forms of consciousness and a more enlightened, decentralized society.",

Katsuhiro Otomo's AKIRA manga (1982) is considered the first work in cyberpunk fiction, while William Gibson's novel Neuromancer (1984) is often credited as another defining masterpiece of the genre.",

Rejecting the flowing, natural forms of Art Nouveau, Czech Cubists drew inspiration from the structure of crystals, creating a distinct style defined by sharp angles, prismatic shapes, and faceted surfaces. This was not just an artistic experiment but also a nationalistic one, as its proponents sought to create a modern and distinctly Czech style, independent of Viennese influence.",

While it aimed to be a nihilistic end to art, Dada's radical questioning of what art could be laid the essential groundwork for Surrealism (which many Dadaists joined) and later movements like Conceptual Art.",

Their style often featured realism and detailed observation of the Danish landscape and society, influenced by the Dutch Golden Age tradition and marked by a distinctive rendering of the Nordic light. Important artists of this movement include Christen Købke, known for his evocative cityscapes and portraits; Martinus Rørbye, known for his depictions of Copenhagen and travels; and Constantin Hansen, recognized for his historical and mythological paintings as well as portraits. The sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen also played a crucial role, creating internationally acclaimed Neoclassical works. In architecture, Christian Frederik Hansen and Michael Gottlieb Bindesbøll influenced the Neoclassical landscape of Copenhagen.",

This reflects Generation Z's embrace of all things maximalist, which can be seen in the asymmetrical decorations, bold color combinations and eye-catching patterns utilised. Much of the aesthetic takes inspiration from modern art that emphasizes shapes in flat colors, such as from Matisse and Picasso.",

Dark Aero's first documented appearance was in Windows Longhorn, a beta version of Windows Vista (developed from 2001-2006); this was during the transition period from Y2K Futurism to Frutiger Aero. Dark Aero preserves the futuristic element of Frutiger Aero while largely omitting the nature/eco side of it. The futuristic approach of Dark Aero centers more around electronics rather than humanism, contrasting Frutiger Aero's style of futurism. During Dark Aero's beginning period in the early 2000s, it went largely unused and was over-shadowed by Frutiger Aero. In the late 2000s-early 2010s, Dark Aero's popularity gradually increased until it started to become more widely adopted across various systems and user interfaces. This was accompanied by the slow decline of Frutiger Aero, which began in 2012-2013.",

Studying religious history and admiring its architecture, music and stories.",

It emphasizes a gloomy or melancholic presentation, typically employing darker color palettes. This aesthetic evolved into Dark Coquette, a distinct Coquette substyle that maintains the darker visual elements while minimizing overt references to trauma or negative experiences. The Waif aesthetic, however, retains some of these darker aspects. Dark Coquette and Dark Nymphet are distinct from Gloomy Coquette, although they are frequently confused.",

Its focus is on the darkness within the human soul, exploring themes of obsession, profound guilt, and the perverse nature of man.",

Huysmans' 1884 novel Against Nature, which explored a protagonist retreating into a self-created inner world, became a significant work for the movement. The literary center of Decadence was The Yellow Book, a quarterly journal published between 1894 and 1897, which, with its deliberate association with the transgressive, caused considerable controversy.",

In their view, vertical and horizontal lines represented the fundamental dualities of the universe, such as spirit and matter, and their dynamic interplay could create universal balance and order. All subjective elements, including expressive brushwork, curved lines, and naturalistic representation, were eliminated to achieve this objective purity.",

The subculture's aesthetics were equally important, defined by the glittery glamour of nightclubs like Studio 54, and exemplified by fashion icons such as Bianca Jagger, whose style of platform shoes, sequins, and jumpsuits became emblematic of the era. The subculture's influence on fashion, dance, and nightlife culture persists well into the modern era.",

The label initially specialized in Vaporwave but also promoted what Russo termed \"dream music.\" After connecting with American producer Luke Laurila (t e l e p a t h テレパシー能力者), the two formed the collaborative project 2814. Their second album, 新しい日の誕生 (Birth of a New Day), released in 2015, became a landmark release that codified the Dreampunk sound, earning critical praise for its immersive, cyberpunk-inspired ambient world-building.",

This perspective originates from Rookie magazine and the photographer Petra Collins, but its look derives from older films and music subcultures and is influenced by the renewed interest in emotional authenticity and artistic look associated with 2010 Hipster and Twee perspectives.",

        "description": "This shift resulted in a radical departure from the grand religious and mythological subjects that dominated the broader European Baroque. Instead, Dutch painters turned to the world around them, producing works characterized by intense realism and a focus on secular themes. A number of distinct genres flourished. Genre painting depicted scenes of everyday life, from the quiet, light-filled domestic interiors of Johannes Vermeer to the boisterous tavern scenes of Jan Steen. Portraiture was in high demand, leading to expressive individual portraits by artists like Frans Hals and the uniquely Dutch tradition of large-scale group portraits of civic guards and guilds, best exemplified by Rembrandt's The Night Watch.",

This era cemented the iconic Emo aesthetic: skinny jeans, tight-fitting band t-shirts, studded belts, and a signature androgynous hairstyle of dyed-black, straightened hair with a long fringe covering one side of the face. The subculture became a major international youth movement, defined by its sensitive and melancholic worldview, and often associated with early social media sites such as Livejournal and Myspace. Emo was a direct precursor to the more colorful and fashion-focused Scene subculture.",

Lyrically, emo rap features dark themes and a mournful, melodic delivery style, influenced by 2000s Midwest emo and emo-pop. The genre frequently blends with pop rap, alternative R&B, and contemporary R&B. Its rise is connected to the early 2010s \"emo revival.\" Early artists like Wicca Phase Springs Eternal, associated with the emo revival, contributed to the genre's formation.",

        "description": "The movement developed as a response to the widespread anxiety, industrialization, and spiritual displacement felt in Germany during the years leading up to World War I. It was not a single, unified style but rather an artistic attitude that found form in two key groups. The first, Die Brücke (The Bridge), was established in Dresden in 1905 by artists including Ernst Ludwig Kirchner and Erich Heckel. They used jarring colors, agitated brushwork, and distorted figures to explore themes of urban alienation, sexuality, and raw human emotion, heavily reviving the woodcut as a medium for its direct and crude expressive power.",

        "description": "The term \"Fauvism\" originated at the 1905 Salon d'Automne in Paris. When the critic Louis Vauxcelles saw the boldly colored canvases of Matisse and his contemporaries exhibited in the same room as a Renaissance-style sculpture, he famously remarked, \"Donatello au milieu des fauves\" (\"Donatello among the wild beasts\"). The name \"Fauves,\" or \"wild beasts,\" was subsequently adopted by the artists themselves. The movement was stylistically indebted to Post-Impressionist painters such as Vincent van Gogh and Paul Gauguin, who had already begun using color with greater emotional freedom. The Fauves pushed this concept further, employing pure, brilliant color applied directly from the paint tube to create a sense of explosion on the canvas. Although the unified movement was short-lived, lasting only until about 1908, its revolutionary use of color had a profound influence on subsequent art movements, particularly German Expressionism and Cubism.",

The fashion is largely built upon the concurrent social media youth fashion trend, Coquette, specifically the Dark Coquette subtype, in addition to Grunge/Soft Grunge influences. It largely depends on the use of dark-colored pieces from hyper-feminine brands from Japan and generous accessories.",

However, this apparent lack of curation is itself a highly specific choice, built around a narrow canon of niche media, particularly 1990s and 2000s anime, and a self-deprecating, often nihilistic worldview.",

The tradition is associated with Andalusian folk culture and the Roma (gitano) minority. Historical evidence indicates a combination of cultural influences in Andalusia. Romani artists contributed significantly to the development and preservation of flamenco. Theories regarding its origins include influences from Castilian sung poetry, Moorish, and Sephardic musical traditions. The cultural composition of Andalusia, including native inhabitants, Muslim, and Castilian populations, along with African influences on instrument development, played a role in its formation. Flamenco's development began before the arrival of Romani people in Andalusia. Although Romani communities were present in other regions of Spain and Europe, flamenco's development occurred uniquely within Andalusia.",

Max Fleischer, driven by an interest in mechanics and art, developed the rotoscope in 1915. This device projected live-action film frame-by-frame, providing a guide for animators to trace, allowing for more elaborate and fluid motion in cartoons. Their first cartoon utilizing this method starred Koko the Clown, a rotoscoped version of Dave Fleischer. These early \"Out of the Inkwell\" cartoons, beginning around 1921, often featured Koko interacting with Max Fleischer in a live-action setting, showcasing a fascination with the process of animation itself.",

Frutiger Eco in particular embodied this sentiment using imagery associated with both the future and nature to create a futuristic, utopic feeling. This sense of futuristic eco-friendliness was in response to the growing worries of climate change at the time (these worries still persist today) and Frutiger Eco (along with Frutiger Aero and its sub-aesthetics) aimed to quell these worries and encourage optimism. This led to Frutiger Eco being largely adopted by corporations, its imagery being used to push the values of eco-friendliness and sustainability.",

Its compositions often lean towards a maximalist design philosophy, distinct from the skeuomorphic realism of aesthetics like Frutiger Aero, focusing instead on stylized, non-photorealistic forms. In animated contexts, designs may flow outwards from a central point, gaining variety and complexity as they grow. This aesthetic was part of a larger trend towards humanist, maximalist computer-aided graphic design in that decade.",

Although this trend seems to have diminished somewhat, the preference for bright, happy colours remains, which is unsurprising, considering how many furry characters are - directly or indirectly - inspired by cartoons. Therefore, the furry fandom is often close to Kidcore.",

Their color palette was often bright and vibrant, drawing from the techniques of Italian Divisionism to create a sense of energy.",

It centered around Gabber music, a harder and faster variant of house music characterized by tempos, often exceeding 180 beats per minute, distorted kick drums, and aggressive melodies. The term \"Gabber\" was coined in 1991 when Dutch DJ and producer D-Shake used the term \"gabberhouse\" to describe this emerging sound during an interview on the VPRO television program \"Onrust\". The word itself is derived from Yiddish, and entered the Dutch language through Bargoens slang, coloquially meaning \"friend\" or \"mate\".",

The fashion consisted of brightly colored, revealing clothing like miniskirts, platform boots, and accessories such as hibiscus flowers and leis, reflecting an influence from Californian surf culture. Heavily promoted in magazines like egg, the Ganguro style was a statement of non-conformity and youth rebellion.",

These included natural material such as untreated wood and macrame, triangular grids and circles (as opposed to the traditional square-based grids), geometrized lettering with additional parallel lines and imagery of various exoticized origins, particularly Native American and Indian. As the Tumblr design interests were appropriated for commercial use, the aesthetic was streamlined, yet the great visual distance between its two major strands prevented it from ever truly coalescing into a unified and coherent visual language.",

Rex frontman Marc Bolan on the BBC music show Top of the Pops, wearing glitter and satin, is often cited as the beginning of the movement. Other British glam rock artists include David Bowie, Mott the Hoople, Sweet, Slade, Mud, Roxy Music and Gary Glitter. Those not central to the genre, such as Elton John, Rod Stewart and Queen, also adopted glam styles. There was a similar scene in the United States, with Alice Cooper, Kiss, The Tubes, Brownsville Station, and Lou Reed being the most popular American exponents of the style. Other American glam artists include the New York Dolls, Sparks, Suzi Quatro, Iggy Pop, Zolar X, The Runaways, Cherry Vanilla, The Magic Tramps, Ruby and the Rednecks, and Jobriath - many of these acts constituted the \"glam punk\" style, a movement that was most prominent in New York City, Los Angeles, and the Northeastern United States. Glam rock declined after the mid-1970s, but influenced other musical genres including punk rock, glam metal, New Romantic, deathrock and gothic rock.",

This can be done, for example, by opening an image file in a text or audio editing program, altering its code, and then saving it back in its original format to reveal unexpected visual distortions. Another popular method, primarily for video, is datamoshing, which exploits compression errors to make pixels from one frame \"melt\" or spill into the next. Other artists engage in circuit bending, the physical modification of electronic devices like keyboards or game consoles to produce unintended and erratic sounds and visuals.",

Although England is the most common setting, these mysteries can take place in any part of the British Empire, such as India or Australia. Although the time period is usually between the 1920s and 1930s, the popularity of the genre led to it being adapted to suit more modern times. Activities such as hunting, cocktail parties, and travel via ship and steam train remained largely unchanged for several decades that followed.",

        "description": "Grandparentcore is an aesthetic related to the common aesthetic depiction of grandparents as a whole. It is a comfortable, whimsical (but not necessarily chaotic) aesthetic centered around focusing on things we enjoy most. Though it may appear simple or even naive at first glance, grandparentcore implies a certain level of expert knowledge in various topics or activities. Most of the things that are involved with grandparentcore are old, vintage, or even antique as it is implied that they have been used or were invented a long time ago. This aesthetic is split into two different aesthetics: Grandmacore and Grandpacore. Though these two groups fall very neatly into binary gender categories, they tend to overlap or borrow from each other. They aren't Female-Grandparentcore and Male-grandparentcore; they are two groups under one overarching umbrella.",

While the aesthetic's back-to-nature and anti-consumerist values are rooted in the Hippie counterculture of the 1960s, the modern Granola subculture is often more mainstream and focused on active outdoor recreation like hiking, climbing, and camping. It is distinguished from the more high-fashion Gorpcore by its less stylized, more casual, and lived-in appearance.",

The associated fashion was a utilitarian, anti-consumerist statement rooted in the Pacific Northwest's working-class culture, consisting of thrifted items like oversized flannel shirts, ripped jeans, band t-shirts, and combat boots. The movement's mainstream popularity was short-lived, largely ending with the breakup of Soundgarden in 1997, but its influence on alternative music and fashion has been profound and long-lasting.",

Only during the 1990s, after Gyaru’s predecessor Bodikon spread in popularity, the term became associated with the subculture of the same name, which highly attracted the attention of the media due to the sheer amount of its followers in Shibuya with their heavy makeup and bleached hair. This specifically happened when Bodikon began to “radicalise” (the look became more extreme, with dyed “chapatsu” (brown), red, and blonde hair, and tanned skin, with barely-there clothing). Before it became a subculture, the style was mainly associated with the fans of the Japanese singer Namie Amuro, who was embracing her tan typical for Okinawans in a time where pale skin was the norm, and the fans imitating her style.",

Because of this, what was deemed Hipster could be quite broad, as any aesthetic linkage with the past, interest in art and music, or \"quirky\" hobbies such as DIY made one a \"hipster.\" As a note, the word hipster coincided/created the beginnings of aesthetic culture on social media, making this mindset highly influential in internet culture.",

Artists during this time made significant advancements in technique, including the development of linear perspective, which created the illusion of realistic, three-dimensional space. The introduction of oil paint to Italy allowed for the use of luminous colors and subtle gradations of light and shadow, such as chiaroscuro and sfumato. This period saw a change in patronage from the Church to wealthy individuals and families, most notably the Medici of Florence, who commissioned both religious and secular works. The traditions and innovations of the Italian Renaissance established a foundation for Western art that continues to influence modern practices.",

The term \"Kandi Kid\" or \"Kandi Raver\" designates individuals who engage in kandi culture.",

Different to the nowadays \"kawaii\", they were associated with a negative image, referring to something \"so pitiable one can't stand it\". Later on, those words were replaced by \"kawaii\" and started to take on a positive strength, instead of being seen as a weakness. However, before the term became used the way it is now, it was mainly used by men to objectify women, and during the 60s, it was very common to be catcalled \"Kawaiko-chan\" (かわい子ちゃん), which is similar to the English \"cutie\". Later on, the meaning of \"kawaii\" changed once again when women started to use it to describe everything that is just like them: cute.",

The name comes from a contraction with kōkōsei, the Japanese word for \"high school\". Thus, Kogal is not strictly a type of Gyaru fashion on its own but rather the name for Gyaru that are students. Technically, adult Gyaru who wear school uniforms as part of fashion aren't considered Kogals but their style is referred to as \"Nanchatte Kogal\" (なんちゃってコギャル) or \"Gyaru Seifuku\" (ギャルい制服). (It's a bit of pedantic distinction, but the English community tends to correct others on it.) While the peak period of the classic Gyaru subculture was during the late 1990s and early 2000s, Kogal peaked in the mid-1990s, especially around the period 1994-1995.",

Clothes are often obtained or sold secondhand from more first-world countries, notably France. Brands range from Weston, Kenzo, Giorgio Armani, Yves Saint Laurent, and more. Another important aspect of sapeur fashion is color combination. Clothes have to stand out, so sapeurs mix, match and combine different parts of their outfits to obtain a unique look. Said clothes are expensive however, therefore sapeurs save up a lot of money to get these outfits. Sapeurs tend to own multiple outfits rather than a singular outfit.",

The style extends to storytelling, with plots designed to be straightforward. The Brussels School, including Edgar P. Jacobs, Bob de Moor, Roger Leloup, and Jacques Martin, adopted this style. Ligne Claire reached peak popularity in the 1950s, but its influence declined in the 1960s. A resurgence occurred in the late 1970s, led by Dutch artists Joost Swarte and Theo van den Boogaart, and French artist Jacques Tardi.",

At the same time, the pre-bubble rise of the McMansion and Tuscan Rustic promoted a heavy-handed use of beige-based, often unremarkable decor to maximize resale values. Rae Dunn also began to spread widely after Dunn entered into a licensing agreement in 2003. Another three-word slogan was promoted by Eat Pray Love, with the memoir coming out in 2006 and the movie in 2010.",

        "description": "The visual aesthetic of Lo-fi Art evolved from its musical counterpart. The term \"lo-fi,\" short for \"low-fidelity,\" originally (and still) described a quality of music production where audible imperfections like tape hiss and vinyl crackle were present due to the use of analog recording equipment. This DIY sound was popularized in the 1980s and was valued for its perceived warmth and authenticity. This musical ethos was later adopted by the underground \"lofi hip-hop\" scene, which blended instrumental beats with a deliberately unpolished, nostalgic sound. The visual language for this music began to form through the influence of animated bumpers on television blocks like [adult swim] and the art styles of anime such as Samurai Champloo.",

        "description": "LOLcore, a portmanteau of \"LOL\" (Laugh Out Loud) and \"-core,\" emerged around 2014 as a reaction to the prevailing mood of seriousness in fashion. The preceding years were defined by \"Normcore,\" a style that celebrated dressing in a deliberately average and unremarkable way. In response, several designers began to inject a sense of fun, humor, and irony into their collections. This new wave of fashion embraced the kitsch and visual language of mass consumerism, transforming everyday objects and pop culture icons into luxury goods. The trend was primarily a catwalk phenomenon, championed by a handful of influential designers and quickly adopted by celebrities known for their bold style, such as Katy Perry, Miley Cyrus, and Rita Ora.",

The genre's original purpose was to function as a self-aware satire of weeaboo and otaku culture, using shock value and dark, often offensive humor to critique and mock what its creators perceived as the fandom's problematic obsessions with underage or otherwise child-looking fictional characters.",

If the aesthetic uses mostly lighter colors, then they tend to be faded to give them a more vintage or a more lighthearted look, blurring the lines between stage magic and genuine sorcery with emphasis on astonishment and dream-like environments. For more horror-based takes on this aesthetic, there is a higher focus on the surreal imagery coupled with even drearier colors in addition to a higher focus on mystery and lies than wonder and spectacle.",

        "description": "French maid was a term applied in the Victorian and early 20th century periods to a lady's maid of French nationality. A lady’s maid was a senior servant who reported directly to the lady of the house, and accompanied her mistress on travel. She helped her mistress with her appearance, including make-up, hairdressing, clothing, jewelry, and shoes, and sometimes served as confidante. A maid of French nationality was considered likely to be more expert in current fashions, and was also able to apply her knowledge of the French language when travelling in Europe.",

For example, they would have unnecessary ornamentation like colors, have no practical function, and are made of poor quality materials. Likewise, the clothing that they can typically be seen wearing is cheap, may fit poorly, and looks tacky. This is not based purposefully on camp, but rather being inexperienced in judging quality.",

As funk spread, it became a primary cultural voice for the favelas. The distinct Mandrake style began to coalesce in the 2000s, a period of significant economic growth in Brazil. Increased access to consumer goods for the working class gave rise to a new subgenre of funk called Funk Ostentação (\"Ostentation Funk\"). This music, and the culture around it, shifted focus to the conspicuous display of wealth, brand names, and luxury items as symbols of success and overcoming poverty.",

La Farfa, credited with coining the term, aimed to offer a positive representation of women who did not conform to Japan's prevailing thin beauty ideals. The magazine featured models, such as Goto Seina, who were described as \"Marshmallow Girls\" and typically weighed between 60-120 kg. This initiative provided a new platform for clothing designed for larger-than-average Japanese body sizes, which were historically difficult to find due to widespread societal discrimination against those perceived as \"chubby\". The term \"Marshmallow Girl\" itself was inspired by the tactile \"heavenly ‘marshmallow feel’\" of a soft stomach, serving as a cutesy re-appraisal of body shapes often subjected to negative labels.",

        "description": "While Meatcore may be viewed as a strange or even disgusting aesthetic, it can be aesthetically pleasing and even deeply meaningful to the people that enjoy it. It may help reflect and express a darker side of people, similar to aesthetics like Gorecore. Additionally, because of its focus on flesh and the body it can serve as an expression of the more animalistic side of humanity (quite like Starrflesh). At the end of the day, we are all just meat, and this idea is not necessarily a scary one. For some, it helps reflect the absurdity of human existence. It is also occasionally used in association with body positivity (i.e. the idea we are all the same flesh and blood so there is no need to feel self-conscious). It has also occasionally been connected to themes of Feminism because of the idea that similar to buying and selling livestock for meat, women have historically been bought and sold for their bodies.",

While originally defined by Simpson as potentially fluid in sexual orientation, the term gained popular usage primarily to describe heterosexual men who challenged traditional masculine norms by openly prioritizing their aesthetic presentation and personal indulgence. This aesthetic gained widespread cultural prominence in the late 1990s and 2000s, reflecting shifts in consumer markets and evolving perceptions of masculinity in a post-industrial society.",

        "description": "Midwest Emo is a sub-genre of emo music that began in the 1990s as a response to the Washington, D.C. emotional hardcore scene, such as Rites of Spring, Moss Icon, and Embrace. Key traits of the genre include emotional and unconventional vocal deliveries, personal and introspective lyrics, and “twinkly” arpeggiated guitar melodies. Bands such as Sunny Day Real Estate, Cap'n Jazz, Mineral, Braid, Christie Front Drive, and The Promise Ring introduced indie/math rock-inspired elements to the D.C. emo-core sound to polish its more abrasive components into a unique style that, while more accessible, maintained its introspective and expressive roots. A key difference between the scenes is that Midwest emo bands prioritized melodic riffs and vocal lines over the furious, punk sensibilities of the emo-core bands they succeeded.",

        "description": "The Mod aesthetic evolved significantly through the 1960s. Early male Mods adopted a clean, sharp look centered on custom-tailored suits with narrow lapels, inspired by Italian and French styles. As the movement grew, this look was popularized by brands like Fred Perry and Ben Sherman, whose polo shirts became a subcultural uniform. For women, Mod fashion became synonymous with the Swinging Sixties, promoting an androgynous and youthful silhouette. Designers like Mary Quant popularized the miniskirt, while A-line dresses, shift dresses, bold geometric patterns, and flat shoes became defining features of the look, famously modeled by figures like Twiggy.",

While its mainstream popularity was relatively brief, the Mod Revival had a lasting influence and established its own distinct identity separate from the original movement.",

        "description": "Many visuals suggest physical abuse, sexual assault/molestation, emotional abuse, self-destruction, religious trauma, and physical disability. The child-like imagery serves as a desire to return to a girlhood that was ripped away from them, with the Christian, angelic, and cute motifs being an idealization of purity and innocence. Religious guilt is a common motif, with the desire to go to Heaven, but feeling unable due to the victim being \"dirtied\" with whatever traumatized them. This can create some overlap with Catholic Horror. The idea of ‘dirtiness’ and rot is a common theme. Poverty within small-town Americana is also present, and it reflects the influence of horror movies and the idea of home being sullied and unsafe.",

It aims to preserve the essence of traditional culture while incorporating current fashion trends, creating garments suitable for various occasions, from casual wear to formal attire.

They would adopt and combine the visual language of conflicting ideologies—such as German Nazism, Italian Futurism, and Soviet Socialist Realism—to expose the mechanisms of power and the seductive nature of political symbols. By taking state ideology more seriously than the state itself, a strategy sometimes called \"over-identification,\" NSK created a deeply ambiguous and provocative art that forced audiences to question their own relationship to authority and national identity.",

The movement became both an eclectic expression of local patriotism and a form of social and cultural critique, often using pseudonyms to conceal ethnic identity and promote a sense of unified Sarajevan street culture.

The aesthetic was eclectic, blending historical costumes with futuristic elements. The scene was closely tied to the rise of synth-pop, and its visual extravagance was perfectly suited for the nascent medium of the music video, which helped propel associated bands like Duran Duran, Spandau Ballet, and Visage to international fame via MTV.",

        "description": "The sound was characterized by jittery, agitated rhythms, quirky vocals, and a prominent use of electronic instruments, particularly synthesizers, which gave it a modern and futuristic feel. Visually, New Wave was defined by its angular, often androgynous fashion, geometric patterns, skinny ties, and bright colors, all of which were famously showcased in the artistic and often bizarre music videos that became staples of early MTV. As a less abrasive and more stylistically diverse counterpart to the darker, more experimental Post-Punk movement, New Wave brought the energy of the underground to the pop charts with influential bands like Talking Heads, Blondie, and The Cars.",

        "description": "As used by K-Hole, \"normcore\" refers to an attitude, not a particular code of dress. It was intended to mean \"finding liberation in being nothing special.\" However, an influential February 2014 piece in New York magazine conflated it with what K-Hole terms \"Acting Basic\", a concept under which dressing neutrally is a means to avoiding standing out. This broader sense of \"normcore\" as referring to understated and noncommittal attitudes to fashion gained popular usage. At the same time, many cultural references that are tied to broadly neutral fashion aesthetics, such as the characters featured on the television series Seinfeld, also exemplify to a significant extent the ethos of normcore in the more radical sense proposed by K-Hole.",

Godin used the term to differentiate the fast-tempo soul music favored by young people in Northern England from the smoother soul popular in London and the South. The sound of Northern Soul was characterized by its heavy beat and fast tempo, which was perfect for the dance style developing in Northern clubs and dance halls, involving stomping, floating, and shuffling. These rare records were known as \"stompers.\"",

Its popularity surged after \"The Responsive Eye\" exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1965, which showcased 123 paintings and sculptures by artists such as Victor Vasarely, Bridget Riley, Frank Stella, Carlos Cruz-Diez, Jesús Rafael Soto, and Josef Albers. This exhibition captivated the public, leading to widespread adoption of Op Art designs in fashion and media, making it seem well-suited for an era marked by scientific and technological advancements.",

Certain street-focused Mods, often from more modest backgrounds and sometimes known as Hard Mods, remained active well into the late-1960s. Many of the Hard Mods lived in the same economically depressed areas of South London as West Indian immigrants, so they favoured a different kind of attire, evolving into Rude Boys and Skinheads by the end of the decade. They gradually distanced themselves from the Swinging London scene and the bourgeoning Hippie movement. By 1967, they viewed most people in the Swinging London scene as \"Soft Mods\" or \"Peacock Mods,\" as fashion there grew increasingly extravagant. Fashion frequently incorporated unconventional elements such as paisley textiles, vivid patterns, vivid colours, and feminine themes.",

        "description": "As a reaction against the dominance of abstract movements like Abstract Expressionism and Minimalism, Photorealism re-engaged with representational imagery, but unlike traditional realism, its source was the camera's lens, not direct observation. The subjects are typically mundane aspects of American life, including cars, diners, storefronts, and portraits, as seen in the work of key figures like Richard Estes, Chuck Close, and Ralph Goings. Beyond just technical skill, the movement explores the relationship between painting, photography, and human perception, questioning the nature of reality by creating a handmade copy of a mechanical reproduction.",

This approach was based on a \"synthesis\" of the outward appearance of a subject, the artist's feelings about that subject, and purely aesthetic considerations of line and color. The resulting works are characterized by bold, flat areas of non-naturalistic color, simplified forms, and strong dark outlines, a technique known as Cloisonnism.",

        "description": "Poolcore can suggest feelings of eeriness and serenity or peacefulness. The way that Poolcore makes you feel is a slight mix of two very separate things, seeing as the feelings of liminality insinuate creepy or eerie feelings of being to place before, or seeing the pools in a dream. It can be relayed to Dreamcore, as dreams are often a thing which incorporate water, so as such, a lot of people will find that they've seen similar (or exact) places like the pools in their own dreams. The peaceful feeling is driven by the clean tiles or the blue and white colors which are a part of the images along with the clear water which can strike one as being serene, hence the feelings of serenity. The nostalgic feeling often associated with Poolcore is one based in logic, as many people went to pools as children, or have been to many in their life. Pools often look fairly similar, so the liminality and nostalgia make sense as the pools one has been to all feel like they cross over as a whole in Poolcore images.",

Key motifs include portraits of celebrities, everyday household items, and images from mass media, often rendered in a straightforward, graphic style.",

Positivity Kawaii, on the other hand, embraces a more playful, modern sensibility that aligns with the digital native generation. Its visual language is often more stylized and less overtly sentimental.",

        "description": "Prairiecore is an aesthetic based off of the life of the American Pioneers and life on the prairie. Batsheva Hay describes her inspiration to be the \"eccentric\" tastes of her mother and grandmother. Though inspired by the U.S, Prairie is not limited to the United States. Like the American pioneers, this aesthetic finds power in freedom and experimenting with new things by using the old as inspiration. Its fashion has both a traditional and modern variant (Uptown Prairie). Key visuals include grasslands, cattle, flowers, wheat, and Pioneer related works. Prairie emerged from the American boho aesthetic during the 1970's, as an offshoot of the hippie/flower child movement. The brand Gunne Sax by Jessica popularized prairie dresses in boho culture at the time, and continues to influence modern Prairie style.",

        "description": "The Pre-Raphaelites are known for their commitment to realism and their depiction of historical, biblical, and mythological subjects with a high degree of detail. Their art is characterized by vibrant, jewel-toned colors and a meticulous rendering of nature. A significant portion of their work focused on literary themes, especially Arthurian legends and the poetry of figures like Keats and Tennyson. A central motif was the portrayal of beautiful, idealized women, often imbued with a sense of tragedy or longing. The Brotherhood disbanded in the early 1850s, but the Pre-Raphaelite style and its influence persisted throughout the late 19th century, evolving into the second phase of the movement with artists like Edward Burne-Jones and William Morris. This second phase emphasized decorative arts and led to the founding of the Arts and Crafts movement.",

It includes signature large quiffs, diverse and often wild clothing, makeup, and stage props like fake blood and skeletons. While rooted in the primitive rock and roll of earlier decades, such as the sound of The Cramps and 1960s garage bands like The Sonics, psychobilly intentionally moved away from strict retro authenticity. Its audience, initially a mix of rockabillies seeking something more punk and punks desiring a different sound, found a focal point in venues like London's Klub Foot. This scene fostered its own practices, such as the \"wrecking\" dance, which involved energetic, flailing movements. Despite its passionate following and established presence, psychobilly largely remained an underground phenomenon, consciously maintaining its outsider status and not seeking mainstream acceptance.",

The style is characterized by clean outlines, balanced compositions, and a subdued palette of flat colors. While the movement was short-lived in painting, its principles became foundational to Le Corbusier's influential architectural theories and the broader development of the International Typographic Style.",

        "description": "Regional Gothic is a Tumblr trend in the mid-2010s wherein users would write bullet-pointed lists of eerie moments related to the region in which they grew up in or other seemingly benign moments in life, such as college. Visually, all regional gothic aesthetics include photography of towns or townspeople with eerie overlays/weather. Imagery of houses, neighborhoods, streets, apartments, and farms are common motifs of this aesthetic. Photos inside houses, schools, and similar buildings are also common. However, cities and more developed, populated areas are less common to see in this aesthetic, if not included at all. Regional gothic emphasizes architecture and people as a collective.",

This led to an eclectic style where artists adopted formal elements from movements like Cubism, Expressionism, and Surrealism but applied them to Galician subjects, including landscapes, portraits of working people, and scenes of social reality. The movement encompassed painting, innovative sculpture by artists like Francisco Asorey, and a strong tradition of graphic satire, with many of its key figures continuing their work in exile in the Americas following the Spanish Civil War.",

Over time with the attention of robots, the machines gained attention being nicknamed \"robots\", a term that originated from a Czech play named R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots). The advancements of coding, technology, and robots in general helped contribute to playing a part in boosting the popularity of these machines. Ever since the '60s, many people have opposed the idea of the existence of robots; some people even fear them, often being concerned about having their jobs taken over, therefore decreasing their income. These people still exist and express their beliefs to this day, especially in regards to many developments in technology that allow robots to perform a variety of tasks (some of which have brought up ethical concerns around the world). People who create and build robots are known as innovators; they ended up leading new generations to become fascinated with robots of all kinds.",

In painting, artists like Jean-Antoine Watteau, François Boucher, and Jean-Honoré Fragonard depicted scenes of aristocratic pastimes, playful mythology, and courtship, rendered in soft colors and hazy light. The aesthetic is defined by a palette of pale pastels—such as powder blues, pinks, and mint greens—accented with ivory whites and gold leaf. Asymmetry, C-scrolls, S-scrolls, and motifs drawn from nature, like shells and foliage, are fundamental to its design.",

The aesthetic is not intended to be historically accurate but rather serves as a playful reinterpretation of history. Adherents of the style emphasize a sense of humor about their costumes and the subculture itself. Participants have described themselves with the portmanteau \"classholes,\" a term meant to capture the fusion of aristocratic Rococo visuals with a defiant punk demeanor. The core philosophy celebrates decadence and excess, deliberately contrasting with the more industrial and subdued color palettes often associated with Steampunk.",

Central to the Rude Boy identity was a sharp sense of style. In a subversion of the social hierarchy, they appropriated the fashion of the upper classes, as well as the look of American jazz musicians and gangsters seen in films. They wore sharp, tailored suits, thin ties, and pork pie or trilby hats, a look that projected an image of sophistication and self-respect.",

        "description": "Sandalpunk, also known as Bronzepunk, is a subgenre of Cyberpunk that is set in an alternate universe in which civilizations during the Ancient era have access to advanced fantastic Bronze-Age or Iron-Age technology. This would potentially lead to a less-isolated retro-futurist Greece that was never conquered or a retro-futurist Roman Empire that never fell. Prime examples would be the mechanical wonders in films like Jason and the Argonauts (1963) and Clash of the Titans (1981) or the God of War video game series. High-technology in such works is rare (usually a \"one-off\" by a genius philosopher or a hand-crafted \"trade secret\" product made by workshops of artificiers) but potentially indistinguishable from miracles or magic. Another example is the retro-futuristic blend of Imperial Rome and 1930s Fascist Italy in Julie Taymor's Titus (1999). There are motor vehicles, radios, and simple firearms, but war is still waged by armor-clad troops with swords and spears.",

Seiz Breur was multidisciplinary, with members working in wood engraving, furniture design, architecture, ceramics, and graphic design, using both traditional motifs like the triskelion and Celtic knots alongside modern techniques.",

Being one of the first internet users in his village of Dongguan, he was heavily inspired by the Visual Kei aesthetic (but admits he knew nothing about the music associated with it) and started by initially mimicking what he saw with the Visual Kei style. It really started to take off from 2009 to 2013 and at its peak, there were about 20,000 shamate, but the community has shrunk since then, but the ones who are still involved in the shamate community have become incredibly strict adherents to it. In recent years, however, the shamate community has seen something of a resurgence, especially on platforms like TikTok.",

A primary form of expression was visual poetry, where text, punctuation, and symbols were arranged on the page to create visual compositions, treating language as a concrete material rather than just a vehicle for meaning. Artists also utilized collage, photography, and performance, and were active participants in the international Mail Art network, which allowed them to bypass official art institutions. Through its journal, Signal, the movement connected with like-minded experimental artists across the globe, becoming a notable hub for neo-avant-garde activity in Eastern Europe during its time.",

        "description": "The trend originated in the mid-2010s as young internet users, particularly on Tumblr, began curating blogs that showcased imagery of Eastern European youth cultures. These blogs often focused on a distinct blend of street photography, paramilitary aesthetics, and religious iconography, reflecting the gritty realities and turbulent history of Slavic and post-Soviet societies. The trend also developed partly as a reaction to the idealized and sanitized aesthetics popular elsewhere online, instead choosing to highlight authenticity, even if that authenticity was uncomfortable or disturbing.",

        "description": "Dissatisfied with the French avant-garde and a perceived isolation from broader society, American artists sought a new artistic vocabulary to address social issues, believing art could be a tool against capitalist exploitation and fascism. This artistic approach is distinct from Soviet Socialist Realism, which became the dominant style in post-revolutionary Russia under Stalin. Social Realists saw themselves as laborers akin to factory and field workers, viewing their artistic practice as a critical contribution to society rather than an elite pursuit. United by a desire to critique the existing social and political power structures, these artists, despite variations in style, maintained a focus on realism, the human figure, and the human condition, building upon the legacies of earlier politically engaged artists. They considered the political content of their work to be a defining aspect of its modernity, diverging from the stylistic innovations of the School of Paris.",

By mimicking the style of official art but filling it with absurd or contradictory content, Sots Art exposed the ideological emptiness and hidden absurdity of the state's propaganda machine. In the same way that Pop Art critiqued capitalism's visual culture, Sots Art provided a satirical deconstruction of the visual culture of communism, making it one of the most significant movements of late-Soviet underground art.",

Its widespread appeal is partly driven by artists who redefine the country aesthetic, and by figures in pop culture who integrate Western motifs with futuristic or glamorous elements. The aesthetic extends to fashion, makeup, and general visual presentation, emphasizing shiny and neon elements, often seen in holographic materials, disco balls, and glitter applications.",

Many artists adopted the lighting technique of tenebrism, using stark contrasts between light and shadow to create psychological depth and dramatic effect. This was particularly evident in the period's dominant subject of religious art. Painters like Francisco de Zurbarán created images of saints, monks, and martyrs with a sense of monumental dignity. In contrast, Bartolomé Esteban Murillo developed a softer style, known for his religious scenes and his portrayals of street urchins.",

There is a spectrum in Spy Fiction from being completely fantastical and even campy to dark and gritty. The commonalities between both is the emphasis on the agent being able to escape dangerous situations, the use of action and disguise, and an organization existing to give orders to the agent.",

        "description": "While the term is modern, the roots of Steampunk can be traced to 19th-century scientific romance writers like Jules Verne and H.G. Wells, whose stories explored advanced technology through the lens of their time. These authors are considered foundational precursors, providing the seeds for the genre. The visual aesthetic of modern Steampunk began to emerge in the mid-20th century, particularly in film and television that romanticized a Victorian vision of the future. The 1960s television series The Wild, Wild West is often cited as an early example of the blend of historical setting and futuristic technology that would define the aesthetic.",

The subculture served as a spontaneous protest against the conformist nature of Soviet society, particularly in terms of behavior, clothing, music, and lifestyle. Until the mid-1960s, Soviet media and officials often labeled any young person who followed Western fashion trends and was perceived as having an \"immoral\" lifestyle as a \"stilyaga.\"",

The Sloop Inn was a popular place for Victorian artists, including Louis Grier, who displayed many of his paintings there. West Cornwall has attracted artists since the early 1800s due to its quality of light. The Great Western Railway's arrival in 1877 made the area easier to access for other English citizens. Newlyn had previously attracted an art school known as the Newlyn School, which was influenced by realism and focused on depicting daily life in Cornwall.",

        "description": "Streamline Moderne emerged in the United States during the early 1930s as a response to the Wall Street crash of 1929 and the Great Depression. Designers, architects and engineers needed to move away from Art Deco's lavish ornaments and luxurious materials to more functional and cheaper ones as a way to cut costs, given the circumstances of that time. They were particularly inspired by aerodynamic design, used in automobiles, locomotives, and aircrafts, which utilize shapes that reduce drag and increase resistance to motion through air. This \"streamlining\" in design has the functional use of optimizing and improving movement in high speeds, but in Streamline Moderne, this form-factor was utilized in less convencional places and products, such as in architecture, interior design, fridges, toasters, radios, and chairs, to give a sense of movement, functionality, sleekness, modernity and progress. In the architectural side, it was also influenced by Futurism, with its dynamic lines and bright colors, evoking speed and the age of machinery. The defining moment for the spread of Streamline Design in the United States would be the 1933–1934 Chicago World's Fair, which introduced the style to the general public, mainly in automobiles and trains.",

He helped other artists to put Japan on the art world map and bridge the gap between fine art and commercial aesthetics, basically Japan's answer to Neo-Pop art.",

        "description": "The core of Suprematist philosophy is non-objectivity. Malevich sought to create a visual language of basic geometric forms (such as squares, circles, and lines) and a limited range of colors. These forms were not intended to symbolize or represent anything from the visible world; instead, they were vessels of pure feeling. His iconic 1915 painting, Black Square, was presented as the \"zero point\" of art, a new beginning where all previous artistic conventions were wiped away. The white backgrounds in his paintings were meant to represent an infinite space or cosmos in which these geometric forms float in dynamic relation to one another.",

The style was a maximalist aesthetic that often featured an abundance of patterns and accessories. A key garment in the style was the harem suit, a shapeless jumpsuit or wide-legged pants with a matching top, often made from cheap, lightweight materials. The clothing came in a range of bright colors, including red, pink, and violet, and was often adorned with ribbons, bows, and fringe. This gaudy and deliberately unrefined aesthetic was a direct contrast to the more traditional and conservative fashion of the era, and it served as a visual statement of individuality and rebellion. The aesthetic of Takenokozoku, with its vibrant colors and focus on group identity through fashion, is sometimes cited as a predecessor to later Japanese street fashion movements like Gyaru.",

        "description": "Techwear mostly grew out of a shared obsession with the craft and innovation of functional, durable, all-weather clothing. Arguably started by Errolson Hugh and Michaela Sachenbacher, the founders of Munich-based label Acronym, techwear became more popular after Hugh teamed up with Nike to relaunch their dormant outerwear sub-brand ACG. Techwear is inspired by the Karasu Zoku subculture and the Japanese Mode movement that followed it. Much of the color palette is black like the former (though other dark colors aren't uncommon), but the forms and patterns of techwear more closely resemble those of the latter. Additionally, techwear draws heavily from the fabrics and innovations of industrial, scientific, paramilitary and ninja apparel. Techwear pieces are often baggy, and have features such as straps, clasps, locks, and multiple large pockets, and they are also usually waterproofed and look to serve a weather-ready purpose with their styled functionality. Therefore, this style may attract people surrounding certain countercultural styles such as alt, urbex, cybergrunge, skatercore or some ramifications of y2k, which can all be combined and intertwined with eachother and Techwear.",

In the 19th century, it was rooted in societal concerns about white women's health and their roles in marriage and motherhood. Later, it became associated with third wave feminism and the rejection of traditional gender roles.",

Initially rooted in the traditional attire of the Spanish lower classes, the suit's design was elevated and codified through art, particularly the works of painter Francisco de Goya, who merged the existing style with influences from French royal fashion. By the 19th century, the modern traje de luces took shape, establishing a clear visual hierarchy where gold embroidery denoted elite fighters, while silver was used for those of a lower rank.",

        "description": "Tudor architecture represents the final development of medieval styles in England, gradually introducing Renaissance elements. Defining features include the low, multi-centered Tudor arch and the increasing use of brick, imported from the Low Countries, which became widespread even for modest buildings by the end of the period. Half-timbered construction, where timber frames were filled with wattle and daub, was common, particularly for vernacular architecture. Buildings of the wealthy often featured E- or H-shaped floor plans, large glass windows with leaded panes, prominent brick chimneys, and classical accents like round-headed arches. Inside, the introduction of chimney stacks led to the decline of the open-hearth great hall, replaced by enclosed hearths and the possibility of full upper stories. Fireplaces were large and elaborate. Long galleries became a fashionable addition in grand houses. Decorative arts of the period saw tapestries used for warmth, decoration, and wealth display, sometimes incorporating gold or silver thread. Gilt detailing was present both indoors and outdoors. Geometric landscaping, including large gardens and enclosed courtyards with fountains, became a feature of wealthy estates. The Tudor rose and the royal coat of arms were frequently used as decorative motifs on structures and furnishings, often incorporating the Welsh dragon reflecting the dynasty's origins.",

The aesthetic pulls heavily from the imagery of beach destinations like Miami and Hawaii during that period, romanticizing a specific type of masculine leisure. The style of figures like Thomas Magnum from the television series Magnum, P.I. (1980-1988), with his signature Hawaiian shirts and moustache, is a primary influence. The aesthetic also incorporates elements from the everyman \"dad\" archetype of the late 20th century, particularly the practical and often un-fashionable choices stereotypically associated with family holidays.",

In honour of this, the people gathered in St Mark's Square and danced. Over the years, this Baroque festival was celebrated for its own sake, with its original meaning fading into obscurity. It encouraged licence and pleasure, allowing Venetians to forget their personal anguish for a while. However, under the rule of the Holy Roman Emperor and later the Emperor of Austria, Francis II, the festival was outlawed entirely in 1797 and the use of masks became strictly forbidden. It reappeared gradually in the 19th century, but only for brief periods and in private feasts, where it became an occasion for artistic creations.",

        "description": "In Great Britain, the government launched the Utility Clothing Scheme, known as CC41, in 1942. This scheme enlisted top designers to create capsule collections that adhered to restrictions on fashion, ensuring quality-controlled fabrics and more efficient production of civilian clothing. The aesthetic favored practical garments with little waste in their production. For women, this meant the rise of woolen skirt suits with stark, menswear-inspired tailoring, featuring narrow and slim silhouettes with accentuated shoulders and slightly nipped waists. Military elements like belts and breast pockets served as adornments. The knee-length shirtwaist dress, particularly the \"Kitty Foyle Dress\" with a contrasting collar and cap sleeves, also reigned due to its simple A-line skirt requiring little volume yet maintaining a polished look.",

The style combines bulky, warm accessories with clothing that emphasizes the figure, such as pairing a miniskirt with thick leg warmers or wearing a tight-fitting knit sweater. The most iconic accessories are made from soft, luxurious textures like faux fur, including large Russian-style ushanka hats, earmuffs, and matching coats. This look is defined by a predominantly light color palette of white, cream, and soft pastels, and is typically photographed in an idealized, isolated snowy forest to enhance its ethereal and romanticized quality.",

On the other hand, there is the hidden, private identity symbolized by the extensive, full-body tattoos known as irezumi. These tattoos are central to the aesthetic, featuring intricate and symbolic Japanese motifs like dragons, tigers, koi fish, and mythological figures, which are typically concealed under clothing.",

Lyrically, the genre focused on themes of teenage life, including innocent romance, daydreams, and mild rebellion. The performers were often young female singers, known as \"yé-yé girls\" (\"chicas yéyé\" in Spain), who became popular idols.
