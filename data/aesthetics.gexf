These brands also incorporated California in their marketing, with connections to Surfer culture and aspirationally attractive models.

This image of a prosperous and orderly &quot;American Dream&quot; was heavily promoted through the advertising and television sitcoms of the period. While often viewed with nostalgia, the aesthetic is also criticized for its rigid social conformity and its exclusion of non-white and non-traditional families, and its idyllic surface has been famously subverted in the Suburban Gothic genre."/>

Art, especially animated sprites, often lacks any outline or shading. Another common design element is text with a dropshadow to add legibility or visual appeal. Because of the low resolution (the consoles in particular were limited to 256-pixel resolution) of these systems relative to the display, the pixels were extremely large, particularly on consumer televisions which could easily be twice the size of a typical CRT display. While 8-bit is generally understood to correspond primarily with the Sega Master System and NES-based console games, this page includes earlier and similar-era media on other platforms like arcades and computers."/>

These stories, inspired by real-life colonial expeditions, filled the public imagination with images of unexplored continents and forgotten civilizations. This formula was perfectly suited for the cheap, mass-produced pulp magazines of the 1930s and 1940s, which solidified the genre&apos;s visual identity through their dynamic cover art. After the decline of the pulp era, the aesthetic was famously revived in the 1980s with films that paid homage to the original serials, cementing the look and feel of the genre for a new generation."/>

In the Kaladesh Plane from Magic the Gathering, the aether has a distinct neon blue, similar to Arcane&apos;s upper-class utopian city Piltover. The Undercity, on the other hand, has a green tinge or as another wiki editor described it &quot;Green everywhere, just green things everywhere.&quot; This darker, undercity variety can also be seen in video games like Bioshock. Depending on the universe, aether may be a naturally occurring phenomenon or a scientifically harnessed one, and colors are often used to differentiate this attitude. This juxtaposition can often be used as a key story element for aetherpunk worlds. Conflict can arise between those who are in tune with natural aether, those who harness and exploit aether, and all the questions about who is able and allowed to access this fundamental, world changing resource gives rise to rebellious factions with a variety of motivations. It also commonly uses stone and gold for most structures with the emphasis being on the gold as well as large amounts of pagan imagery."/>

Curator Ingrid LaFleur describes it as a method for envisioning future possibilities through a black cultural lens. Bennett Capers&apos; work, as summarized by Kathy Brown, characterizes Afrofuturism as a practice that acknowledges both historical and future-oriented perspectives, addressing a difficult past and present while focusing on future prosperity.

These feelings, which have collectively been coined as kenopsia, include a mix of nostalgia, melancholy, and a sense of surrealism. The emptiness of the abandoned space and the remains of its former vitality can create a powerful emotional response. For some, it might cause them to reflect on the passage of time, the transience of life, or the impermanence of human activities.

    <attvalue for="description" value="The aesthetics of classic arcades have had a lasting impact on popular culture, serving as a deep well of inspiration for various modern art forms and internet subcultures. The nostalgic appeal of 8-bit graphics, chiptune music, and the overall sensory environment has been reinterpreted in numerous ways. The music and visual aesthetic of Synthwave, for example, is heavily indebted to the 1980s, with arcades as a central theme in its neon-gridded, futuristic visuals that directly reference the look of classic games. Similarly, while drawing from a broader range of nostalgia, Vaporwave frequently incorporates elements of early computer and video game graphics, evoking a sense of digital history connected to the arcade era. This influence also extends to Glitch Art, a form that intentionally uses digital errors for aesthetic purposes, harkening back to the visual artifacts of early video game hardware. Furthermore, the resurgence of pixel art in modern indie gaming is a direct homage to the arcade era, with many contemporary developers making a deliberate artistic choice to evoke nostalgia and celebrate the timeless appeal of classic game design."/>

The style is based on either the practice outfits or the performance costumes of professional ballet dancers, which includes very specific trends and textiles that developed separately from mainstream fashion. Throughout fashion trends, ballet has always had some influence, but with this trend, the trend was more explicit, with the entire outfit being ballet-inspired, as well as the name being prominent."/>

Over time, the term lost its negative connotations. The defining characteristics of Baroque art are drama, movement, and emotional intensity. Artists sought to capture the most dramatic moment of a story, using dynamic compositions with strong diagonal lines, swirling forms, and figures caught in motion. In painting, the technique of chiaroscuro (the use of strong contrasts between light and dark) was perfected by artists like Caravaggio to create theatrical effects."/>

Aesthetically, the Bauhaus is known for its use of clean lines, simple geometric forms (circles, squares, triangles), and a palette often restricted to primary colors (red, yellow, blue), black, and white. Its innovative curriculum began with a preliminary course (Vorkurs) that taught students the fundamentals of materials, color theory, and composition before they entered specialized workshops."/>

    <attvalue for="description" value="Blokette, a microtrend popularized on TikTok, was coined by the fashion commentary podcast Nymphet Alumni in late 2022. This aesthetic blends elements of Blokecore and Coquette styles. Blokecore involves masculine-leaning pieces such as oversized football jerseys, vintage sports jackets, and Adidas Sambas, drawing from a simplified interpretation of English pub and sports culture. In contrast, the Coquette aesthetic is hyper-feminine, focusing on elements like mini skirts, knee-high socks, and hair ribbons."/>

    <attvalue for="description" value="The B-Movie Horror aesthetic is a love letter to a mostly bygone era of film. It is taken from the often outlandish looks of cheaply-made 1930s-1980s B-horror movies, which aimed not to stay in the public consciousness as great pieces of art but instead to entertain (and in this case scare) audiences for the duration of their runtimes, and make some money, then be forgotten. Still, many of these old horror films have gained cult followings and enjoy a place in modern culture thanks to memorable characters, plots, effects, and of course the aesthetic. Features of this aesthetic include grainy or washed-out-looking footage, cheap effects (especially prosthetics and fake blood), ridiculous but distinctively styled posters, and dramatic title screens."/>

Its components, &quot;chic&quot; and &quot;bon genre,&quot; were concepts highly valued by French high society in the 19th century and had roots in the social codes of the Ancien Régime. The modern BCBG subculture evolved as a reaction against the countercultural movements of the era, such as the Hippie and Bohemian styles, offering a more traditional and sophisticated alternative. Characterized by an elegant and relaxed style inspired by prestigious French schools, it became associated with a specific lifestyle and even naming conventions."/>

This play ended up being adopted and also seen as a form of entertainment by the African slaves who lived in the Brazilian colonies, who had fun in their free time while mixing drumming and African rhythms with Portuguese music. This mixture of genres and rhythms would give rise to the carnival marchinhas and samba, which would become fundamental genres for the festival. The original Shrovetide play, however, was no longer practiced, because many upper-class citizens saw it as something uncivilized for the party, which made them adopt elements from Carnivals in other countries (specifically France) that replaced water, flour and eggs with colorful confetti, streamers and bouquets of flowers, which was seen as the most ideal for the festivity. Another element adopted from these countries were the traditional masks, originating from the Masquerade Ball, which were also well received."/>

Bubble Bujo uses a lot of bright, vibrant colors; similar to Kidcore, but with some slightly different styles. Some popularly used items are stickers, ribbons, cartoon bears, cakes, sparkles, hearts, and smiley faces. Letter stickers are also used. The Korean brand called &quot;THENCE&quot; is very popular in Bubble Bujo. While binders/diaries are the most popular, some other popular things to decorate are CDs and photocards, which are included in K-Pop albums and collected by fans. There are smaller binders specifically for these photocards. Keychains are often attached to 6-ring binders, and vary from small, thin keychains with cutesy pictures to beaded straps to resin shaker keychains."/>

    <attvalue for="description" value="Cassette Futurism can be seen as similar to Cyberpunk and Neon Noir, drawing inspiration from Cyberpunk novels and films of the 1980s (Tron, Blade Runner), as well as the Cypherpunk/Early Cyber movement of the 1990s which promoted online anonymity. It also shares connections with the Mundane Dogmatic science fiction genre, which emphasizes advanced technology used alongside older devices. Cassette Futurism also shares similarities with Vaporwave and Synthwave, albeit the latter styles do not incorporate as many 1970s elements."/>

The Daily Mirror described the group as wearing clothing such as Pringle jumpers, denims, and training shoes. This attire was indicative of the &quot;casual&quot; style that had developed within British working-class youth culture. Regional variations existed, with corduroy flares in Manchester and baggy jumpers and sheepskin coats in Liverpool. The style emphasized smart and expensive clothing, with a shift from Fred Perry and Pringle to higher-end sportswear and designer brands."/>

A key feature of the style was the prominent use of designer patterns, most famously the Burberry check, which was often worn in the form of baseball caps and scarves, though its prevalence was largely through the counterfeit market. The look is accessorized with bold, often gold-plated, jewelry such as large hoop earrings for women (&quot;chavettes&quot;) and heavy chain necklaces for men. Associated grooming styles include specific haircuts, the use of artificial tanning products, and a distinct makeup application featuring heavy foundation, dramatically defined eyebrows, and thick mascara or false eyelashes."/>

The term quickly went viral and was amplified by major fashion and lifestyle publications. Its popularity was further cemented by endorsements from celebrities who are considered icons of the style, including Diane Keaton and Anne Hathaway, transforming it from a niche TikTok trend into a mainstream cultural phenomenon."/>

The Hippie movement reached new heights with the beginning of the Summer of Love; the Summer of Love was a social phenomenon that occurred during the summer of 1967, when as many as 100,000 people, mostly young people sporting Hippie fashions of dress and behavior, converged in San Francisco&apos;s neighborhood of Haight-Ashbury. The Beatnik movement is widely accepted as the predecessor to the Hippie subculture."/>

Nowadays, imitations of the style are widely seen in various websites, advertisements, logos, and even user interfaces. As a result, there has been a growing awareness for this minimalist look, with many people complaining about the monotony and oversaturation of the style."/>

The movement drew inspiration from both artistic Realism and Romanticism, despite their contradicting philosophies. It embraced Realism&apos;s depictions of the observable reality, while presenting it through an idealized, and at times satirical, lens characteristic of Romanticism."/>

However, despite its progressive and subversive aspects, Cottagecore has been criticized for romanticizing Eurocentric farming life and, in North American and Australian contexts, for inadvertently celebrating colonial aesthetics. This contrasts with its simultaneous adoption by the politically conservative Tradwife movement, which is drawn to the same traditional imagery but for reasons of reinforcing patriarchal gender roles, creating a significant ideological tension within the aesthetic."/>

The second was the non-Western art of Africa and ancient Iberia, which offered a more conceptual and less naturalistic way of representing forms. Picasso’s 1907 painting, Les Demoiselles d&apos;Avignon, is considered a seminal work that marks the beginning of Cubism, integrating these influences into a new, radical visual language."/>

    <attvalue for="description" value="The term &quot;cybergoth&quot; was first coined by the roleplaying game company Games Workshop in 1988 for their game Dark Future. However, this use of the term is unrelated to the subculture that would later adopt the name. The Cybergoth subculture and fashion style emerged independently in the late 1990s out of a fusion of the German and Austrian rave scenes and the industrial music scene. The precursors to cybergoths were sometimes referred to as &quot;Gravers&quot; (a portmanteau of &quot;Gothic Ravers&quot;), who were individuals from the rave scene who began frequenting goth and industrial clubs."/>

Their style often featured realism and detailed observation of the Danish landscape and society, influenced by the Dutch Golden Age tradition and marked by a distinctive rendering of the Nordic light. Important artists of this movement include Christen Købke, known for his evocative cityscapes and portraits; Martinus Rørbye, known for his depictions of Copenhagen and travels; and Constantin Hansen, recognized for his historical and mythological paintings as well as portraits. The sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen also played a crucial role, creating internationally acclaimed Neoclassical works. In architecture, Christian Frederik Hansen and Michael Gottlieb Bindesbøll influenced the Neoclassical landscape of Copenhagen."/>

Dark Aero&apos;s first documented appearance was in Windows Longhorn, a beta version of Windows Vista (developed from 2001-2006); this was during the transition period from Y2K Futurism to Frutiger Aero. Dark Aero preserves the futuristic element of Frutiger Aero while largely omitting the nature/eco side of it. The futuristic approach of Dark Aero centers more around electronics rather than humanism, contrasting Frutiger Aero&apos;s style of futurism. During Dark Aero&apos;s beginning period in the early 2000s, it went largely unused and was over-shadowed by Frutiger Aero. In the late 2000s-early 2010s, Dark Aero&apos;s popularity gradually increased until it started to become more widely adopted across various systems and user interfaces. This was accompanied by the slow decline of Frutiger Aero, which began in 2012-2013."/>

Huysmans&apos; 1884 novel Against Nature, which explored a protagonist retreating into a self-created inner world, became a significant work for the movement. The literary center of Decadence was The Yellow Book, a quarterly journal published between 1894 and 1897, which, with its deliberate association with the transgressive, caused considerable controversy."/>

In their view, vertical and horizontal lines represented the fundamental dualities of the universe, such as spirit and matter, and their dynamic interplay could create universal balance and order. All subjective elements, including expressive brushwork, curved lines, and naturalistic representation, were eliminated to achieve this objective purity."/>

Genre painting depicted scenes of everyday life, from the quiet, light-filled domestic interiors of Johannes Vermeer to the boisterous tavern scenes of Jan Steen. Portraiture was in high demand, leading to expressive individual portraits by artists like Frans Hals and the uniquely Dutch tradition of large-scale group portraits of civic guards and guilds, best exemplified by Rembrandt&apos;s The Night Watch."/>

This era cemented the iconic Emo aesthetic: skinny jeans, tight-fitting band t-shirts, studded belts, and a signature androgynous hairstyle of dyed-black, straightened hair with a long fringe covering one side of the face. The subculture became a major international youth movement, defined by its sensitive and melancholic worldview, and often associated with early social media sites such as Livejournal and Myspace. Emo was a direct precursor to the more colorful and fashion-focused Scene subculture."/>

It is defined by melancholic production, combining atmospheric cloud rap elements and trap drum patterns with samples from alternative rock and emo genres, including Midwest Emo, emo-pop, and pop-punk. Lyrically, emo rap features dark themes and a mournful, melodic delivery style, influenced by 2000s Midwest emo and emo-pop. The genre frequently blends with pop rap, alternative R&amp;B, and contemporary R&amp;B. Its rise is connected to the early 2010s &quot;emo revival.&quot; Early artists like Wicca Phase Springs Eternal, associated with the emo revival, contributed to the genre&apos;s formation."/>

The first, Die Brücke (The Bridge), was established in Dresden in 1905 by artists including Ernst Ludwig Kirchner and Erich Heckel. They used jarring colors, agitated brushwork, and distorted figures to explore themes of urban alienation, sexuality, and raw human emotion, heavily reviving the woodcut as a medium for its direct and crude expressive power."/>

    <attvalue for="description" value="The term &quot;Fauvism&quot; originated at the 1905 Salon d&apos;Automne in Paris. When the critic Louis Vauxcelles saw the boldly colored canvases of Matisse and his contemporaries exhibited in the same room as a Renaissance-style sculpture, he famously remarked, &quot;Donatello au milieu des fauves&quot; (&quot;Donatello among the wild beasts&quot;). The name &quot;Fauves,&quot; or &quot;wild beasts,&quot; was subsequently adopted by the artists themselves. The movement was stylistically indebted to Post-Impressionist painters such as Vincent van Gogh and Paul Gauguin, who had already begun using color with greater emotional freedom. The Fauves pushed this concept further, employing pure, brilliant color applied directly from the paint tube to create a sense of explosion on the canvas. Although the unified movement was short-lived, lasting only until about 1908, its revolutionary use of color had a profound influence on subsequent art movements, particularly German Expressionism and Cubism."/>

The tradition is associated with Andalusian folk culture and the Roma (gitano) minority. Historical evidence indicates a combination of cultural influences in Andalusia. Romani artists contributed significantly to the development and preservation of flamenco. Theories regarding its origins include influences from Castilian sung poetry, Moorish, and Sephardic musical traditions. The cultural composition of Andalusia, including native inhabitants, Muslim, and Castilian populations, along with African influences on instrument development, played a role in its formation. Flamenco&apos;s development began before the arrival of Romani people in Andalusia. Although Romani communities were present in other regions of Spain and Europe, flamenco&apos;s development occurred uniquely within Andalusia."/>

Max Fleischer, driven by an interest in mechanics and art, developed the rotoscope in 1915. This device projected live-action film frame-by-frame, providing a guide for animators to trace, allowing for more elaborate and fluid motion in cartoons. Their first cartoon utilizing this method starred Koko the Clown, a rotoscoped version of Dave Fleischer. These early &quot;Out of the Inkwell&quot; cartoons, beginning around 1921, often featured Koko interacting with Max Fleischer in a live-action setting, showcasing a fascination with the process of animation itself."/>

The style features natural materials such as wood and stone, often with distressed or aged finishes. Warm, muted colors are typical, along with the use of toile fabrics, floral patterns, and other rustic motifs. Furniture often incorporates cabriole legs and delicate carvings. French Provincial architecture is characterized by symmetrical designs, arched windows and doorways, and the use of natural materials like stone and brick. The style evokes a sense of timeless elegance and a connection to the French countryside."/>

Frutiger Eco in particular embodied this sentiment using imagery associated with both the future and nature to create a futuristic, utopic feeling. This sense of futuristic eco-friendliness was in response to the growing worries of climate change at the time (these worries still persist today) and Frutiger Eco (along with Frutiger Aero and its sub-aesthetics) aimed to quell these worries and encourage optimism. This led to Frutiger Eco being largely adopted by corporations, its imagery being used to push the values of eco-friendliness and sustainability."/>

It centered around Gabber music, a harder and faster variant of house music characterized by tempos, often exceeding 180 beats per minute, distorted kick drums, and aggressive melodies. The term &quot;Gabber&quot; was coined in 1991 when Dutch DJ and producer D-Shake used the term &quot;gabberhouse&quot; to describe this emerging sound during an interview on the VPRO television program &quot;Onrust&quot;. The word itself is derived from Yiddish, and entered the Dutch language through Bargoens slang, coloquially meaning &quot;friend&quot; or &quot;mate&quot;."/>

As the Tumblr design interests were appropriated for commercial use, the aesthetic was streamlined, yet the great visual distance between its two major strands prevented it from ever truly coalescing into a unified and coherent visual language."/>

Rex frontman Marc Bolan on the BBC music show Top of the Pops, wearing glitter and satin, is often cited as the beginning of the movement. Other British glam rock artists include David Bowie, Mott the Hoople, Sweet, Slade, Mud, Roxy Music and Gary Glitter. Those not central to the genre, such as Elton John, Rod Stewart and Queen, also adopted glam styles. There was a similar scene in the United States, with Alice Cooper, Kiss, The Tubes, Brownsville Station, and Lou Reed being the most popular American exponents of the style. Other American glam artists include the New York Dolls, Sparks, Suzi Quatro, Iggy Pop, Zolar X, The Runaways, Cherry Vanilla, The Magic Tramps, Ruby and the Rednecks, and Jobriath - many of these acts constituted the &quot;glam punk&quot; style, a movement that was most prominent in New York City, Los Angeles, and the Northeastern United States. Glam rock declined after the mid-1970s, but influenced other musical genres including punk rock, glam metal, New Romantic, deathrock and gothic rock."/>

This can be done, for example, by opening an image file in a text or audio editing program, altering its code, and then saving it back in its original format to reveal unexpected visual distortions. Another popular method, primarily for video, is datamoshing, which exploits compression errors to make pixels from one frame &quot;melt&quot; or spill into the next. Other artists engage in circuit bending, the physical modification of electronic devices like keyboards or game consoles to produce unintended and erratic sounds and visuals."/>

Most of the things that are involved with grandparentcore are old, vintage, or even antique as it is implied that they have been used or were invented a long time ago. This aesthetic is split into two different aesthetics: Grandmacore and Grandpacore. Though these two groups fall very neatly into binary gender categories, they tend to overlap or borrow from each other. They aren&apos;t Female-Grandparentcore and Male-grandparentcore; they are two groups under one overarching umbrella."/>

Only during the 1990s, after Gyaru’s predecessor Bodikon spread in popularity, the term became associated with the subculture of the same name, which highly attracted the attention of the media due to the sheer amount of its followers in Shibuya with their heavy makeup and bleached hair. This specifically happened when Bodikon began to “radicalise” (the look became more extreme, with dyed “chapatsu” (brown), red, and blonde hair, and tanned skin, with barely-there clothing). Before it became a subculture, the style was mainly associated with the fans of the Japanese singer Namie Amuro, who was embracing her tan typical for Okinawans in a time where pale skin was the norm, and the fans imitating her style."/>

    <attvalue for="description" value="Hair Metal, also known as Glam Metal, is a subgenre of metal music that emerged and peaked in popularity during the 1980s until its decline in the early 1990s. Originating in the United States, this genre differed from other metal subgenres of the time due to its striking, androgynous, and glamorous image, evident in both the musicians&apos; appearance and their music. Hair metal emphasized catchy riffs and guitar solos (often featuring shredding), melodic hooks, and lyrics focused on themes of love and lust."/>

On the other hand, Halloween is often linked with horror, which involves a large variety of genres that have their own associated tropes that carry over into different visuals for the holiday. For example, people who enjoy more elegant aesthetics tend to decorate or dress themselves in a Gothic theme, while people who enjoy slasher movies enjoy jump scares and sometimes even (fake) gore."/>

However, rather than alternative subcultures which are visually and philosophically a rejection of majority trends (such as Punk), Hipsters seek to be more familiar with the mainstream and deviate it out of a search for uniqueness while still participating within the mainstream. Because of this, what was deemed Hipster could be quite broad, as any aesthetic linkage with the past, interest in art and music, or &quot;quirky&quot; hobbies such as DIY made one a &quot;hipster.&quot; As a note, the word hipster coincided/created the beginnings of aesthetic culture on social media, making this mindset highly influential in internet culture."/>

They talk very poetically, describing experiences quite deeply and eclectically. Some examples are moments when you are loving someone, how disastrous and messy they are, and what they want to or are doing right now.

    <attvalue for="description" value="The term is often used interchangeably with Swiss Style, but they are sometimes considered to be different but closely related phenomenons. The International Typographic Style primarily emphasizes typography and visual communication, while the Swiss Style encompasses a broader range of graphic design styles from Switzerland, particularly during the 1950s and 1960s. Nevertheless, both movements have the same core principles of clarity, objectivity, and functionality."/>

Artists during this time made significant advancements in technique, including the development of linear perspective, which created the illusion of realistic, three-dimensional space. The introduction of oil paint to Italy allowed for the use of luminous colors and subtle gradations of light and shadow, such as chiaroscuro and sfumato. This period saw a change in patronage from the Church to wealthy individuals and families, most notably the Medici of Florence, who commissioned both religious and secular works. The traditions and innovations of the Italian Renaissance established a foundation for Western art that continues to influence modern practices."/>

However, before the term became used the way it is now, it was mainly used by men to objectify women, and during the 60s, it was very common to be catcalled &quot;Kawaiko-chan&quot; (かわい子ちゃん), which is similar to the English &quot;cutie&quot;.

Technically, adult Gyaru who wear school uniforms as part of fashion aren&apos;t considered Kogals but their style is referred to as &quot;Nanchatte Kogal&quot; (なんちゃってコギャル) or &quot;Gyaru Seifuku&quot; (ギャルい制服). (It&apos;s a bit of pedantic distinction, but the English community tends to correct others on it.) While the peak period of the classic Gyaru subculture was during the late 1990s and early 2000s, Kogal peaked in the mid-1990s, especially around the period 1994-1995."/>

Another important aspect of sapeur fashion is color combination. Clothes have to stand out, so sapeurs mix, match and combine different parts of their outfits to obtain a unique look. Said clothes are expensive however, therefore sapeurs save up a lot of money to get these outfits. Sapeurs tend to own multiple outfits rather than a singular outfit."/>

The term &quot;lo-fi,&quot; short for &quot;low-fidelity,&quot; originally (and still) described a quality of music production where audible imperfections like tape hiss and vinyl crackle were present due to the use of analog recording equipment. This DIY sound was popularized in the 1980s and was valued for its perceived warmth and authenticity. This musical ethos was later adopted by the underground &quot;lofi hip-hop&quot; scene, which blended instrumental beats with a deliberately unpolished, nostalgic sound. The visual language for this music began to form through the influence of animated bumpers on television blocks like [adult swim] and the art styles of anime such as Samurai Champloo."/>

In response, several designers began to inject a sense of fun, humor, and irony into their collections. This new wave of fashion embraced the kitsch and visual language of mass consumerism, transforming everyday objects and pop culture icons into luxury goods. The trend was primarily a catwalk phenomenon, championed by a handful of influential designers and quickly adopted by celebrities known for their bold style, such as Katy Perry, Miley Cyrus, and Rita Ora."/>

It was created by artists like Onomatopeee and Loli Ripe, a collective of anonymous users from 4chan. The genre&apos;s original purpose was to function as a self-aware satire of weeaboo and otaku culture, using shock value and dark, often offensive humor to critique and mock what its creators perceived as the fandom&apos;s problematic obsessions with underage or otherwise child-looking fictional characters."/>

Increased access to consumer goods for the working class gave rise to a new subgenre of funk called Funk Ostentação (&quot;Ostentation Funk&quot;).

    <attvalue for="description" value="The &quot;Marshmallow Girl&quot; phenomenon originated in Japan in 2013 with the launch of La Farfa, a new plus-size fashion magazine. La Farfa, credited with coining the term, aimed to offer a positive representation of women who did not conform to Japan&apos;s prevailing thin beauty ideals. The magazine featured models, such as Goto Seina, who were described as &quot;Marshmallow Girls&quot; and typically weighed between 60-120 kg. This initiative provided a new platform for clothing designed for larger-than-average Japanese body sizes, which were historically difficult to find due to widespread societal discrimination against those perceived as &quot;chubby&quot;. The term &quot;Marshmallow Girl&quot; itself was inspired by the tactile &quot;heavenly ‘marshmallow feel’&quot; of a soft stomach, serving as a cutesy re-appraisal of body shapes often subjected to negative labels."/>

It may help reflect and express a darker side of people, similar to aesthetics like Gorecore. Additionally, because of its focus on flesh and the body it can serve as an expression of the more animalistic side of humanity (quite like Starrflesh). At the end of the day, we are all just meat, and this idea is not necessarily a scary one. For some, it helps reflect the absurdity of human existence. It is also occasionally used in association with body positivity (i.e. the idea we are all the same flesh and blood so there is no need to feel self-conscious). It has also occasionally been connected to themes of Feminism because of the idea that similar to buying and selling livestock for meat, women have historically been bought and sold for their bodies."/>

    <attvalue for="description" value="Midwest Emo is a sub-genre of emo music that began in the 1990s as a response to the Washington, D.C. emotional hardcore scene, such as Rites of Spring, Moss Icon, and Embrace. Key traits of the genre include emotional and unconventional vocal deliveries, personal and introspective lyrics, and “twinkly” arpeggiated guitar melodies. Bands such as Sunny Day Real Estate, Cap&apos;n Jazz, Mineral, Braid, Christie Front Drive, and The Promise Ring introduced indie/math rock-inspired elements to the D.C. emo-core sound to polish its more abrasive components into a unique style that, while more accessible, maintained its introspective and expressive roots. A key difference between the scenes is that Midwest emo bands prioritized melodic riffs and vocal lines over the furious, punk sensibilities of the emo-core bands they succeeded."/>

Early male Mods adopted a clean, sharp look centered on custom-tailored suits with narrow lapels, inspired by Italian and French styles. As the movement grew, this look was popularized by brands like Fred Perry and Ben Sherman, whose polo shirts became a subcultural uniform. For women, Mod fashion became synonymous with the Swinging Sixties, promoting an androgynous and youthful silhouette. Designers like Mary Quant popularized the miniskirt, while A-line dresses, shift dresses, bold geometric patterns, and flat shoes became defining features of the look, famously modeled by figures like Twiggy."/>

The child-like imagery serves as a desire to return to a girlhood that was ripped away from them, with the Christian, angelic, and cute motifs being an idealization of purity and innocence. Religious guilt is a common motif, with the desire to go to Heaven, but feeling unable due to the victim being &quot;dirtied&quot; with whatever traumatized them. This can create some overlap with Catholic Horror. The idea of ‘dirtiness’ and rot is a common theme. Poverty within small-town Americana is also present, and it reflects the influence of horror movies and the idea of home being sullied and unsafe."/>

Artists employed a wide range of colors and techniques, emphasizing freedom of expression and a departure from traditional artistic norms. Works of New Figuration frequently conveyed a sense of social critique, using cynical, cruel, or mocking representations of reality. The historical context of the movement includes the aftermath of World War II, which influenced the artists&apos; use of dark colors and themes of war and suffering. New Figuration also drew upon informalism, incorporating its emphasis on formless figures and dramatic brushstrokes."/>

This emphasis introduced Sarajevan street jargon, slang, and Turkish loanwords into the official Yugoslav public sphere. The movement became both an eclectic expression of local patriotism and a form of social and cultural critique, often using pseudonyms to conceal ethnic identity and promote a sense of unified Sarajevan street culture. The movement officially disbanded in 1987, although its principal groups and television show continued for several more years."/>

This broader sense of &quot;normcore&quot; as referring to understated and noncommittal attitudes to fashion gained popular usage. At the same time, many cultural references that are tied to broadly neutral fashion aesthetics, such as the characters featured on the television series Seinfeld, also exemplify to a significant extent the ethos of normcore in the more radical sense proposed by K-Hole."/>

Its popularity surged after &quot;The Responsive Eye&quot; exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1965, which showcased 123 paintings and sculptures by artists such as Victor Vasarely, Bridget Riley, Frank Stella, Carlos Cruz-Diez, Jesús Rafael Soto, and Josef Albers. This exhibition captivated the public, leading to widespread adoption of Op Art designs in fashion and media, making it seem well-suited for an era marked by scientific and technological advancements."/>

It features high-pitched, often processed vocals, bright, jittery synth melodies, and experimental electronic textures. The fusion of this unique sound with a highly conceptual visual world has made PC Music one of the most influential cultural movements of the 2010s, laying the direct groundwork for the mainstream emergence of Hyperpop."/>

    <attvalue for="description" value="The Peacock Revolution was largely a consequence of the declining Mod subculture, forming into many varied offshoot subcultures. Certain street-focused Mods, often from more modest backgrounds and sometimes known as Hard Mods, remained active well into the late-1960s. Many of the Hard Mods lived in the same economically depressed areas of South London as West Indian immigrants, so they favoured a different kind of attire, evolving into Rude Boys and Skinheads by the end of the decade. They gradually distanced themselves from the Swinging London scene and the bourgeoning Hippie movement. By 1967, they viewed most people in the Swinging London scene as &quot;Soft Mods&quot; or &quot;Peacock Mods,&quot; as fashion there grew increasingly extravagant. Fashion frequently incorporated unconventional elements such as paisley textiles, vivid patterns, vivid colours, and feminine themes."/>

    <attvalue for="description" value="Dissatisfied with the Impressionist focus on capturing fleeting visual reality, these artists, particularly Gauguin and Émile Bernard, developed a new style called Synthetism. This approach was based on a &quot;synthesis&quot; of the outward appearance of a subject, the artist&apos;s feelings about that subject, and purely aesthetic considerations of line and color. The resulting works are characterized by bold, flat areas of non-naturalistic color, simplified forms, and strong dark outlines, a technique known as Cloisonnism."/>

    <attvalue for="description" value="Poolcore can suggest feelings of eeriness and serenity or peacefulness. The way that Poolcore makes you feel is a slight mix of two very separate things, seeing as the feelings of liminality insinuate creepy or eerie feelings of being to place before, or seeing the pools in a dream. It can be relayed to Dreamcore, as dreams are often a thing which incorporate water, so as such, a lot of people will find that they&apos;ve seen similar (or exact) places like the pools in their own dreams. The peaceful feeling is driven by the clean tiles or the blue and white colors which are a part of the images along with the clear water which can strike one as being serene, hence the feelings of serenity. The nostalgic feeling often associated with Poolcore is one based in logic, as many people went to pools as children, or have been to many in their life. Pools often look fairly similar, so the liminality and nostalgia make sense as the pools one has been to all feel like they cross over as a whole in Poolcore images."/>

Like the American pioneers, this aesthetic finds power in freedom and experimenting with new things by using the old as inspiration. Its fashion has both a traditional and modern variant (Uptown Prairie). Key visuals include grasslands, cattle, flowers, wheat, and Pioneer related works. Prairie emerged from the American boho aesthetic during the 1970&apos;s, as an offshoot of the hippie/flower child movement. The brand Gunne Sax by Jessica popularized prairie dresses in boho culture at the time, and continues to influence modern Prairie style."/>

Their art is characterized by vibrant, jewel-toned colors and a meticulous rendering of nature. A significant portion of their work focused on literary themes, especially Arthurian legends and the poetry of figures like Keats and Tennyson. A central motif was the portrayal of beautiful, idealized women, often imbued with a sense of tragedy or longing. The Brotherhood disbanded in the early 1850s, but the Pre-Raphaelite style and its influence persisted throughout the late 19th century, evolving into the second phase of the movement with artists like Edward Burne-Jones and William Morris. This second phase emphasized decorative arts and led to the founding of the Arts and Crafts movement."/>

    <attvalue for="description" value="Psychobilly has evolved into a youth subculture with its own aesthetic. It includes signature large quiffs, diverse and often wild clothing, makeup, and stage props like fake blood and skeletons. While rooted in the primitive rock and roll of earlier decades, such as the sound of The Cramps and 1960s garage bands like The Sonics, psychobilly intentionally moved away from strict retro authenticity. Its audience, initially a mix of rockabillies seeking something more punk and punks desiring a different sound, found a focal point in venues like London&apos;s Klub Foot. This scene fostered its own practices, such as the &quot;wrecking&quot; dance, which involved energetic, flailing movements. Despite its passionate following and established presence, psychobilly largely remained an underground phenomenon, consciously maintaining its outsider status and not seeking mainstream acceptance."/>

The style is characterized by clean outlines, balanced compositions, and a subdued palette of flat colors. While the movement was short-lived in painting, its principles became foundational to Le Corbusier&apos;s influential architectural theories and the broader development of the International Typographic Style."/>

These include Steampunk (Victorian-era visions), Dieselpunk (interwar period, 1920s-1940s visions), Raygun Gothic (Art Deco-influenced future), Space Age (optimistic space race 1950s-1960s visions), Atompunk (Cold War, 1950s-1960s visions), Cassette Futurism (1970s-1980s, late Cold War era), Cyberpunk (1980s-1990s, digital-age visions), Y2K Futurism (late 1990s-early 2000s, tech anticipation), and Frutiger Aero (mid-2000s-early 2010s, eco-friendly tech visions). Each of these subsets focuses on specific technological themes and cultural anxieties from their respective eras of origin, while still operating under the broader Retrofuturist principle."/>

While some bands adjacent to the movement shared a similar aesthetic, such as grunge acts like Babes in Toyland and L7, they were often not considered part of the broader political movement.

The advancements of coding, technology, and robots in general helped contribute to playing a part in boosting the popularity of these machines. Ever since the &apos;60s, many people have opposed the idea of the existence of robots; some people even fear them, often being concerned about having their jobs taken over, therefore decreasing their income. These people still exist and express their beliefs to this day, especially in regards to many developments in technology that allow robots to perform a variety of tasks (some of which have brought up ethical concerns around the world). People who create and build robots are known as innovators; they ended up leading new generations to become fascinated with robots of all kinds."/>

In painting, artists like Jean-Antoine Watteau, François Boucher, and Jean-Honoré Fragonard depicted scenes of aristocratic pastimes, playful mythology, and courtship, rendered in soft colors and hazy light. The aesthetic is defined by a palette of pale pastels—such as powder blues, pinks, and mint greens—accented with ivory whites and gold leaf. Asymmetry, C-scrolls, S-scrolls, and motifs drawn from nature, like shells and foliage, are fundamental to its design."/>

The aesthetic is not intended to be historically accurate but rather serves as a playful reinterpretation of history. Adherents of the style emphasize a sense of humor about their costumes and the subculture itself. Participants have described themselves with the portmanteau &quot;classholes,&quot; a term meant to capture the fusion of aristocratic Rococo visuals with a defiant punk demeanor. The core philosophy celebrates decadence and excess, deliberately contrasting with the more industrial and subdued color palettes often associated with Steampunk."/>

    <attvalue for="description" value="Sandalpunk, also known as Bronzepunk, is a subgenre of Cyberpunk that is set in an alternate universe in which civilizations during the Ancient era have access to advanced fantastic Bronze-Age or Iron-Age technology. This would potentially lead to a less-isolated retro-futurist Greece that was never conquered or a retro-futurist Roman Empire that never fell. Prime examples would be the mechanical wonders in films like Jason and the Argonauts (1963) and Clash of the Titans (1981) or the God of War video game series. High-technology in such works is rare (usually a &quot;one-off&quot; by a genius philosopher or a hand-crafted &quot;trade secret&quot; product made by workshops of artificiers) but potentially indistinguishable from miracles or magic. Another example is the retro-futuristic blend of Imperial Rome and 1930s Fascist Italy in Julie Taymor&apos;s Titus (1999). There are motor vehicles, radios, and simple firearms, but war is still waged by armor-clad troops with swords and spears."/>

Artists also utilized collage, photography, and performance, and were active participants in the international Mail Art network, which allowed them to bypass official art institutions. Through its journal, Signal, the movement connected with like-minded experimental artists across the globe, becoming a notable hub for neo-avant-garde activity in Eastern Europe during its time."/>

This artistic approach is distinct from Soviet Socialist Realism, which became the dominant style in post-revolutionary Russia under Stalin. Social Realists saw themselves as laborers akin to factory and field workers, viewing their artistic practice as a critical contribution to society rather than an elite pursuit. United by a desire to critique the existing social and political power structures, these artists, despite variations in style, maintained a focus on realism, the human figure, and the human condition, building upon the legacies of earlier politically engaged artists. They considered the political content of their work to be a defining aspect of its modernity, diverging from the stylistic innovations of the School of Paris."/>

Because of their close-knit community on Tumblr, they developed a &quot;not-like-other-girls&quot; attitude, especially in contrast with the more mainstream and cheerful bright colors of the time. This style later declined, yet has gained short-term popularity in 2020 due to a desire to escape to the past."/>

By mimicking the style of official art but filling it with absurd or contradictory content, Sots Art exposed the ideological emptiness and hidden absurdity of the state&apos;s propaganda machine. In the same way that Pop Art critiqued capitalism&apos;s visual culture, Sots Art provided a satirical deconstruction of the visual culture of communism, making it one of the most significant movements of late-Soviet underground art."/>

Painters like Francisco de Zurbarán created images of saints, monks, and martyrs with a sense of monumental dignity.

    <attvalue for="description" value="Streamline Moderne emerged in the United States during the early 1930s as a response to the Wall Street crash of 1929 and the Great Depression. Designers, architects and engineers needed to move away from Art Deco&apos;s lavish ornaments and luxurious materials to more functional and cheaper ones as a way to cut costs, given the circumstances of that time. They were particularly inspired by aerodynamic design, used in automobiles, locomotives, and aircrafts, which utilize shapes that reduce drag and increase resistance to motion through air. This &quot;streamlining&quot; in design has the functional use of optimizing and improving movement in high speeds, but in Streamline Moderne, this form-factor was utilized in less convencional places and products, such as in architecture, interior design, fridges, toasters, radios, and chairs, to give a sense of movement, functionality, sleekness, modernity and progress. In the architectural side, it was also influenced by Futurism, with its dynamic lines and bright colors, evoking speed and the age of machinery. The defining moment for the spread of Streamline Design in the United States would be the 1933–1934 Chicago World&apos;s Fair, which introduced the style to the general public, mainly in automobiles and trains."/>

Malevich sought to create a visual language of basic geometric forms (such as squares, circles, and lines) and a limited range of colors. These forms were not intended to symbolize or represent anything from the visible world; instead, they were vessels of pure feeling. His iconic 1915 painting, Black Square, was presented as the &quot;zero point&quot; of art, a new beginning where all previous artistic conventions were wiped away. The white backgrounds in his paintings were meant to represent an infinite space or cosmos in which these geometric forms float in dynamic relation to one another."/>

    <attvalue for="description" value="Takenokozoku fashion is characterized by its vivid, colorful, and loose-fitting clothing. The style was a maximalist aesthetic that often featured an abundance of patterns and accessories. A key garment in the style was the harem suit, a shapeless jumpsuit or wide-legged pants with a matching top, often made from cheap, lightweight materials. The clothing came in a range of bright colors, including red, pink, and violet, and was often adorned with ribbons, bows, and fringe. This gaudy and deliberately unrefined aesthetic was a direct contrast to the more traditional and conservative fashion of the era, and it served as a visual statement of individuality and rebellion. The aesthetic of Takenokozoku, with its vibrant colors and focus on group identity through fashion, is sometimes cited as a predecessor to later Japanese street fashion movements like Gyaru."/>

    <attvalue for="description" value="Techwear mostly grew out of a shared obsession with the craft and innovation of functional, durable, all-weather clothing. Arguably started by Errolson Hugh and Michaela Sachenbacher, the founders of Munich-based label Acronym, techwear became more popular after Hugh teamed up with Nike to relaunch their dormant outerwear sub-brand ACG. Techwear is inspired by the Karasu Zoku subculture and the Japanese Mode movement that followed it. Much of the color palette is black like the former (though other dark colors aren&apos;t uncommon), but the forms and patterns of techwear more closely resemble those of the latter. Additionally, techwear draws heavily from the fabrics and innovations of industrial, scientific, paramilitary and ninja apparel. Techwear pieces are often baggy, and have features such as straps, clasps, locks, and multiple large pockets, and they are also usually waterproofed and look to serve a weather-ready purpose with their styled functionality. Therefore, this style may attract people surrounding certain countercultural styles such as alt, urbex, cybergrunge, skatercore or some ramifications of y2k, which can all be combined and intertwined with eachother and Techwear."/>

    <attvalue for="description" value="The distinct clothing of the bullfighter evolved from the 18th century, when the practice was a form of entertainment for Spanish nobility. Initially rooted in the traditional attire of the Spanish lower classes, the suit&apos;s design was elevated and codified through art, particularly the works of painter Francisco de Goya, who merged the existing style with influences from French royal fashion. By the 19th century, the modern traje de luces took shape, establishing a clear visual hierarchy where gold embroidery denoted elite fighters, while silver was used for those of a lower rank."/>

    <attvalue for="description" value="Tudor architecture represents the final development of medieval styles in England, gradually introducing Renaissance elements. Defining features include the low, multi-centered Tudor arch and the increasing use of brick, imported from the Low Countries, which became widespread even for modest buildings by the end of the period. Half-timbered construction, where timber frames were filled with wattle and daub, was common, particularly for vernacular architecture. Buildings of the wealthy often featured E- or H-shaped floor plans, large glass windows with leaded panes, prominent brick chimneys, and classical accents like round-headed arches. Inside, the introduction of chimney stacks led to the decline of the open-hearth great hall, replaced by enclosed hearths and the possibility of full upper stories. Fireplaces were large and elaborate. Long galleries became a fashionable addition in grand houses. Decorative arts of the period saw tapestries used for warmth, decoration, and wealth display, sometimes incorporating gold or silver thread. Gilt detailing was present both indoors and outdoors. Geometric landscaping, including large gardens and enclosed courtyards with fountains, became a feature of wealthy estates. The Tudor rose and the royal coat of arms were frequently used as decorative motifs on structures and furnishings, often incorporating the Welsh dragon reflecting the dynasty&apos;s origins."/>

The aesthetic pulls heavily from the imagery of beach destinations like Miami and Hawaii during that period, romanticizing a specific type of masculine leisure. The style of figures like Thomas Magnum from the television series Magnum, P.I. (1980-1988), with his signature Hawaiian shirts and moustache, is a primary influence. The aesthetic also incorporates elements from the everyman &quot;dad&quot; archetype of the late 20th century, particularly the practical and often un-fashionable choices stereotypically associated with family holidays."/>

In honour of this, the people gathered in St Mark&apos;s Square and danced. Over the years, this Baroque festival was celebrated for its own sake, with its original meaning fading into obscurity. It encouraged licence and pleasure, allowing Venetians to forget their personal anguish for a while. However, under the rule of the Holy Roman Emperor and later the Emperor of Austria, Francis II, the festival was outlawed entirely in 1797 and the use of masks became strictly forbidden. It reappeared gradually in the 19th century, but only for brief periods and in private feasts, where it became an occasion for artistic creations."/>

It draws inspiration from an idealized representation of American life, fashion, and culture spanning the 1950s through the 1980s. This aesthetic is rooted in nostalgia for a perceived simpler past, using elements of Old Hollywood glamour, mid-century girlhood, and iconic Americana imagery."/>

While the Futurists celebrated the constant sensation of motion and speed, the Vorticists aimed to capture the still, concentrated point of energy at the center of a whirlwind; the &quot;vortex.&quot; Their art was not about flux, but about capturing a moment of organized, contained force. This resulted in a hard-edged, angular, and highly abstract style that often depicted machine-like forms and urban scenes rendered with sharp lines."/>

This scheme enlisted top designers to create capsule collections that adhered to restrictions on fashion, ensuring quality-controlled fabrics and more efficient production of civilian clothing. The aesthetic favored practical garments with little waste in their production. For women, this meant the rise of woolen skirt suits with stark, menswear-inspired tailoring, featuring narrow and slim silhouettes with accentuated shoulders and slightly nipped waists. Military elements like belts and breast pockets served as adornments. The knee-length shirtwaist dress, particularly the &quot;Kitty Foyle Dress&quot; with a contrasting collar and cap sleeves, also reigned due to its simple A-line skirt requiring little volume yet maintaining a polished look."/>

The style combines bulky, warm accessories with clothing that emphasizes the figure, such as pairing a miniskirt with thick leg warmers or wearing a tight-fitting knit sweater. The most iconic accessories are made from soft, luxurious textures like faux fur, including large Russian-style ushanka hats, earmuffs, and matching coats. This look is defined by a predominantly light color palette of white, cream, and soft pastels, and is typically photographed in an idealized, isolated snowy forest to enhance its ethereal and romanticized quality."/>

His musical style involves heavily bit-crushed and sped-up vocals with diverse sampling, referencing 2000s Internet culture and video games like Love Hina Sim Date RPG, Tekken, Counter-Strike 1.6, and Runescape. Album art often includes screenshots from obscure dating simulators, foreign internet imagery, and familiar but distorted visuals."/>

    <attvalue for="description" value="Although the concept of the aesthetic has existed for some time, it wasn&apos;t until 2013 that it started to spread under the name Yume Kawaii. Eventually, the rise of image-centric social media platforms gave birth to online groups such as &quot;Strawberry Milk Gang&quot; (いちごみるく団) that were a major contributor to shaping the aesthetic with their image edits. In 2015, Yume Kawaii caught the attention of companies, and pastel-colored goods with the aesthetic in mind hit up the shelves, spreading its popularity among a mainstream audience."/>

The style emerged around 1890, as Witkiewicz aimed to establish a foundation for modern Polish national architecture rooted in Podhale art, connected to the Young Poland art movement. Promoters of this style included W. Matlakowski, W. Eljasz-Radzikowski, and J. Wojciechowski, with the &quot;Przegląd Zakopiański&quot; journal, published from 1899 to 1906, serving as a platform for its popularization."/>

By embracing leisure, foreign fashion, and &quot;degenerate&quot; American jazz music, the Zazous embodied an understated challenge to authority. Their visible nonconformity and refusal to hide their activities in clandestine settings made them a noticeable and often targeted group by the authorities."/>

You&apos;re poor but you&apos;re sexy, you&apos;ve got style.&quot; The subculture is characterized by a DIY ethos, a confrontational sense of humor, and a visual style that is intentionally garish and provocative."/>
